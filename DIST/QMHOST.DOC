         Quick-Start Host Instructions.

         You will use the following files:

            QMHOST.DOC    (You're reading it)
            QMHOST.BAT    Required file for Shell to DOS to work
            PRELOG.HST    Sample Host opening file
            MENU.HST      Sample Main Menu file
            PROTS.HST     Sample Protocols available file
            LOGOFF.HST    Sample Closing message file
            HELP?.HST     Sample HELP files for each Host Command


Step 1.  Place these files in your Qmodem directory.

Step 2.  Verify that Alt-N has all the correct settings to answer the phone
         and hang up.  This is best accomplished by running your modem
         through Quick Modem Config in Qinstall (or from Alt-N in Qmodem)

Step 3.  Verify you have defined subdirectories in the Alt-N/H/D and
         Alt-N/H/U directory paths.  This will be where the Uploads and
         Downloads reside.  Do NOT place your HST files in there!  These
         should remain in your default QMODEM subdirectory.

Step 4.  Verify the Alt-N/H settings.  Make sure the time online is set to
         a reasonable value.  Note: Downloads are not compared to the time
         remaining.  After a download has completed/aborted, the time
         remaining is compared and the appropriate action is taken.

Step 5.  Make sure your current directory is the Qmodem directory.

Step 6.  Press Alt-V and Edit the QMHOST.PWD file and add your name to the
         top.  The Alt-V command is:

                 @FSE QMHOST.PWD

         The Entry to be added to the PWD file looks like this:

                 JOHN FRIEL PASSWORD 1 ; The Sysop!

         The fields should be SPACE separated.  The '1' means you can
         shut the system down from remote with the 'Z' command (provided
         you remember the Shutdown Password).  All other users should
         have a level 0.  (this is planned for future growth)   If you
         have it set as an OPEN system, all new users will automatically
         get a level 0 when they are added to the file.  If you have a
         CLOSED system, then the users have to be pre-coded or it will
         deny them access.

Step 7.  Start Qmodem and press Alt-5.  You should then see the
         'Waiting for Calls' message.  Then press F1 to log in locally.

Step 8.  Log off.  Have a friend call and test your system out while you
         watch.  Just for security sake.



Setting up the 'Shell to DOS'


Step 1.  Verify that the QMHOST.BAT file is in the current directory or in
         the PATH= statement.  This BAT file should have the following
         line in it:

         DOORWAY PORT:%3:%4 /M:60 /S:* /K:0 /G:ON /A:ON /V:D^U /C:DOS

         You can modify this BAT file to do additional commands before and
         after the Drop-to-DOS if need be.  The DOORWAY line itself
         should NOT be modified.


Thats it!  Your Qmodem Host mode should be up and running!
