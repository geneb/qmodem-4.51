          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                     1
          =================================================================



      WHAT IS QMODEM TEST-DRIVE?

          This TEST DRIVE version of QMODEM is a full-featured modem
          communications program. It is designed to allow the user to be
          able to evaluate QMODEM and determine if it meets their needs.
          The TEST DRIVE release is not the latest release of the program,
          however, and does not include all the features of the REGISTERED
          USER VERSION. This TEST DRIVE release includes full documentation
          and information on obtaining the REGISTERED USER VERSION. 

      WHAT DO I GET WHEN I REGISTER?

          New Qmodem users can register for $99 and prior Qmodem registered
          users can upgrade for only $35. All registered users receive:

          -  A copy of the latest release of the Registered User Version
             packaged as a commercial program with dual media diskettes;

          -  A more comprehensive, updated, typeset operations manual;

          -  Free technical support by phone between 9:00am and 5:00pm
             Pacific time;

          -  Automatic notification of any major program updates;

          -  Additional program updates at a significantly reduced rate;

          -  Access to proprietary utility programs, written by both MSI
             and other authors, which enhance and add features;

          -  24-hour access to the private multi-line Registered Users BBS
             at Mustang Software.

          The REGISTERED USER VERSION of QMODEM has many features not found
          in the TEST DRIVE release and includes a free copy of Off-Line
          Xpress (OLX), a QWK compatible mail reading program for reading
          and replying to messages downloaded from services and BBS
          systems.

          A registration form is supplied on disk in the text file
          REGISTER.FRM. You can print a form from within QMODEM with the
          Alt I (information) command, or from the DOS prompt with the
          command

             COPY A:REGISTER.FRM PRN

          It contains complete pricing information, and may be used to mail
          in your order.

          procedures. If you're still stumped, technical support is only a
          phone call away. You may first want to call our BBS system at
          805-395-0650 for valuable insight by other QMODEM users. Feel
          free to look around, download any files on the system that may be
          of use to you, or leave a [C]omment to the Sysop if you need a
          question answered. This method of obtaining support is especially
          good if you want expert guidance regarding the more advanced
          features.

          Another alternative is CompuServe where we are a part of the PC
          Vendor Support Forum. You reach us by typing GO PCVEN and then

          quick explanation, please give us a call between 9:00am and
          5:00pm Pacific time. You can reach technical support at 
          (805) 334-2240. We must, however, limit tech calls to those
          problems not resolved after reading this manual. Technical
          support is not (and should not be) a substitute for this manual.
          Bear in mind that most other software companies will not even
          support a product until it is registered. We want to extend
          special support to users of this TEST-DRIVE release, but need
          your cooperation in checking the manual first.

      DEFINITIONS

          Throughout the documentation, you may run into technical terms or
          everyday computer terminology with which you are not familiar.
          Following are some text examples you may come across:

          ENTER        This represents the Return or Enter key on the
                       keyboard. If you see this in the text, press the
                       Enter key rather than typing in the string.

          ESC          This refers to the Esc key on the keyboard.

          Alt-[char]   Alt- is always followed by a character which means
                       press and hold the Alt Key and hit the following
                       letter. Alt-A means hold the Alt key down and press
                       'A'.

          Ctrl-[char]  Is executed the same way the Alt- is handled. You
                       press and hold the Ctrl key and then press the
                       following letter. Ctrl key combinations may also be
                       specified by the ^ (carat) as in ^T (Ctrl-T).

          =================================================================



      SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE requires an IBM PC,XT,AT,PS/2 or IBM
          compatible computer with at least 384K RAM, a Color Graphics or
          Monochrome adapter and monitor, and a serial port and modem.

      OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS
           
          Three multitasking environments are supported:

             *   DESQview; from QuarterDeck Systems.
             *   TaskView/OmniView; from Sunny Hill Software.
             *   Windows version 3.0 and greater from Microsoft.

          DESQview and Windows allow QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to run in a
          window without requiring the whole screen. TaskView takes a
          slightly different approach and gives QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE an
          entire screen when the partition is selected. All of these
          multi-tasking programs let you be more productive by running
          other software at the same time as QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          The Utilities Disk contains special configuration files for
          DESQview and Windows.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE may not operate properly when other
          background software is running. By other background software, we
          mean programs that are loaded in the CONFIG.SYS, or by a BAT file
          and remain in memory. Certain screen clock programs, for example,
          are known to interfere with serial port operations.

          If you experience loss of incoming data or other unpredictable
          problems, it is possible that one of these programs is
          interfering with QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. Remove these programs or
          device drivers from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file one at a
          time until you find the offender.

          Another method is to start DOS without any resident programs or
          device drivers and add them back in, one at a time, until the
          culprit is identified. Most expanded memory drivers, mouse
          drivers, and hard-disk partitioning software drivers do not
          interfere with QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operation.

          One program which is known to interfere seriously with serial
          port operations is the clock driver supplied with some early
          memory and multi-function boards.

          Conflicts with QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE may not be caused by a
          single program, but by a combination of programs, which, taken
          singly, cause no problems. Therefore, if you suspect some

          =================================================================



          conflict, you should boot your system with only absolutely
          necessary device drivers and resident programs (i.e. a
          partitioned disk device driver).

      INSTALLING QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE

          Back up your diskettes! The first thing you should do is back up
          your QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE distribution disks. Always backup your
          disks! I can't stress this enough! Please refer to your DOS
          manual if you are not sure how to backup your disks.

      FLOPPY DISK INSTALLATION

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE diskettes have come pre-installed and you
          only need to make backups. Be aware that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          does require one of the following floppy drive setups:

          2 - 360K floppy drives

          This allows you to use one of the floppy drives for downloading.
          The drive with the QMODEM.OVR file must never be removed during
          operation.

          1 - 720K floppy & 1 - 360K floppy

          This allows all of the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE files to remain on
          the 720K drive and allows the 360K to act as the data disk for
          downloading and uploading. You should be able to split the files
          as if you have 2 360K drives and use the 720K as your data disk.
          Again, the floppy with the QMODEM.OVR file must never be removed
          during operation.

          Copy all of the files from the distribution diskette to a working
          diskette. The recommended files on each diskette are as follows:

          Disk #1   QMODEM.OVR   (overlay for main program)
                    QMODEM.CNF   (configuration file)
                    QMODEM.FON   (Alt-D phone book)
                    QMODEM.PRE   (phone book prefixes)
                    QMODEM.KEY   (function key text)
                    QM.BAT       (startup BATCH file)
                    COMMAND.COM  (to allow shelling to DOS)

          Disk #2   QMODEM.HLP   (online help)
                    QMODEM.EXE   (main program)
                          *.SCR  (optional script files)

          When using a single 720K or 1.2mb drive, disks #1 and #2 are
          combined on the single floppy.

          =================================================================



      STARTING QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE FROM FLOPPY DRIVES

          Follow these directions:

          1. Place a bootable DOS disk in drive A: and press Ctrl-Alt-Del.

          2. Place disk #1 in drive A: and disk #2 in drive B:.

          3. Type QM and press ENTER at the A> prompt.

          4. When the "Terminal mode" message appears on the screen, you
             can remove disk #2 from the B: drive and use it as a SCRATCH
             disk for uploads and download.

          NOTE: Before running the Alt-N Setup or accessing the Online
          Help, make sure disk #2 is back in the B: drive.

          The QM.BAT file should look something like this:

          PATH A:\;B:\
          B:QMODEM

          The first line allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to search both drives
          for files it may need to allocate. The second line tells DOS to
          load QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE from the B: drive and remain logged to
          the A: drive. This is important, because you may want to remove
          the B: disk after QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE has loaded.

      HARD DISK INSTALLATION

          When installing QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE on a hard disk, all of the
          floppy disks should be copied into the \QMODEM subdirectory. You
          should also modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows:

          1. Add the C:\QMODEM subdirectory to your existing PATH=
             statement.

          2. Add a SET QMODEM=C:\QMODEM (or the name of the subdirectory
             you create). This is an environment variable that QMODEM 4.5
             TEST DRIVE checks when it is loaded. If it finds one, then it
             will also search the defined subdirectory for any of the
             QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE specific files it requires.

          Making these two adjustments allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to be
          started from any subdirectory without needing a special BAT file.
          You could start QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE from your word-processor
          directory simply by typing QMODEM at the DOS prompt!

      SUBDIRECTORY STRUCTURE

          It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words... Here is a
          picture of one possible QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE subdirectory setup
          on a hard disk:

                 QMODEMÄÂÄDOWNLOAD
                        ÃÄHOSTDIR
                        ÀÄSCRIPTS

          The QMODEM\DOWNLOAD directory will be used to store all uploaded
          and downloaded files. A separate directory is optional, but
          having it will make it easier for you to see what you have
          transferred.

          The QMODEM\HOSTDIR is similar to the QMODEM\DOWNLOAD directory,
          but is used by the internal Host mode of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.
          Callers to the HOST will be restricted to this directory.

          The QMODEM\SCRIPTS directory is used for script file storage.
          Keeping scripts in a dedicated directory makes script maintenance
          easier. Copy all .SCR files from the distribution disks to this
          directory.

      GETTING HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE features context-sensitive help. As the
          name suggests, relevant help information is available for any
          command as you execute it, just by pressing the F1 Help Key.

          For example... You have the Alt-K window open and pressed F1. The
          help window would look like this:

          have been, so you can retrace your steps backwards by pressing
          Alt-F1 back to the original screen.

          The online help is not all-inclusive, which is why you are
          reading this paragraph. Although the context-sensitive help is as
          detailed as possible, it still is no substitute for this
          documentation.

          Summary command help is available from the HOME window by
          pressing the F1 key, followed by the desired command key
          combination. When the F1 key is pressed, the status line changes

          For example, to get summary help for the Translate Table command
          (Alt-A), press Alt-A, and the Translate Table summary help window
          will be displayed.

          If you pressed F1 by mistake, press ESC to return to the previous
          Status Line.

          Pressing ESC will exit 99.9% of all windows and QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE functions without making any changes.

      UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE

          Please refer to the file README.1ST on the first disk. This
          contains specific instructions for upgrading from previous
          releases of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

      COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS 

          Certain QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE features are (out of necessity)
          implemented via command line parameters and have no terminal mode
          or script command equivalents. Command line parameters are not
          case sensitive and may be specified in any order.

          The following DOS command-line parameters are valid when starting
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE:
          m
          /HOST

          Will invoke the Host Mode immediately after startup. This option
          can be used to start an unattended Host system as soon as the
          machine is booted, by adding the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE start
          command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

          /S=SCRIPT.SCR

          Autoexec Script: the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE script file to be
          executed immediately upon startup. The script file must be
          located in the script directory as specified in Alt-N/D/S or in
          the current directory if the Alt-N/D/S field is blank.

          /STATS

          Shows the technical information while QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is
          loading. Such things as: Number of Scroll-back lines, UART
          detected and so on.

          video mode at start-up. As long as your video card allows setting
          the AL register to the desired mode, this will do the trick.

          /VEGAVGA=[mode]

          An Option Specific to the VEGA VGA cards from Video-7 Inc. Allows
          setting an alternate text mode (like 132x43) from the command
          line. This is different from the normal /VGA= command because the
          Video Seven boards have to load the registers in a non-standard
          way.

          /R

          This allows you to restart QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE without being
          prompted to send the modem init string if you are already online.

      THE STATUS LINE 

          While in terminal mode, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE displays many of
          its operational settings in the Status Line at the bottom of the
          screen:


      1        2         3          4       5    /-------- 6 --------\      7
     ANSI   Offline 38400 8N1  [Home]=Menu   FDX 8 LF X B M CP LG . PR  21:25:49


          Some of the special characters used in the status line are
          unprintable and may cause erratic printer behavior. These
          characters were changed to insure proper printing.

          The status line is divided into the following areas:

          1: The terminal emulation in effect. In the above example, ANSI
             emulation is active.

          2: The Online/Offline indicator. When connected to another
             computer, the word "Online" will be displayed in this area.
             When QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is first started, this indicator
             should read "Offline". It could also display either "DOORWAY"
             or "doorway" if the Alt-= toggle is set ON. The upper case
             Doorway means you are Online, while lower case means you are
             Offline.

          3: The current communication parameters: Baud Rate, Data Bits,
             Parity, and Stop Bits. These values will change to reflect
             changes made with the Alt-P command, or to reflect the values
             defined in the Dialing directory for each number.

          stripped, and an "8"   means all bits are used.

          LF Add Linefeed Toggle. If "LF", a Linefeed will be added to all
          incoming  Carriage Returns. If disabled, this area will be blank.

          X  XON/XOFF toggle. If "X", Xon/Xoff flow control is active. If
             this area is blank, Xon/Xoff flow control is ignored by
             QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          B  Beeps & Bells Toggle (Shown on-screen as a single musical
             note). If present, indicates that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will
             generate sounds on the PC's speaker when specific conditions
             are met. If this is blank, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE produces no
             sounds.

          M  Music Toggle (Shown on-screen as a double musical note). If
             present, indicates that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will play ANSI
             Music if found. If blank, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will not play
             ANSI music.

          CP Capture Buffer Toggle. If present, indicates that text is
             being captured to a file. If blank, incoming text is not
             captured.

          LG Session Log Toggle. If present, indicates that the Session
             LOG is active. If blank, the session LOG is not active.

          ^  Scroll-back Toggle (Shown on-screen by an up-arrow). If
             present, QMODEM TEST DRIVE is capturing incoming data to the
             scroll-back buffer. If blank, the scroll-back feature is not
             active.

          PR Printer Toggle. If present, screen text is also sent to the
             printer.

          7: The last item on the Status Line is the System Clock. When

                    Operating these toggles is usually done by pressing the
                    corresponding key combination.

          Notice that the Terminal Mode status line changes when the Home
          Menu is displayed (see above example) As the Home status line
          indicates, you can get summary help for any command by pressing
          [F1], then the desired command key combination. Pressing [ESC]
          returns you to terminal mode.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE updates or replaces the Status Line to
          reflect the current environment, the function being performed, or
          the command being executed. Check the Status Line often, it may
          help you get out of trouble if and when you get stuck!

      QINSTALL

          Starting QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE for the First Time 

          If this is your first time, you need to run the program QINSTALL
          before you can run QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. This is the
          installation program that fine tunes QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.
          Qinstall is started by typing Qinstall and pressing the Enter key
          from the DOS prompt.

          After the Qinstall opening screen, you are presented with the
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Installation Part 1 screen:

                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE INSTALLATION PART 1

   The file QMODEM.CNF was not found in the current directory or the directory
   pointed to by the Environment variable "QMODEM=",  so it is assumed this is
   a new installation.   A few questions will be asked to determine how Qmodem
   should be setup for you.  Please follow the  directions and  this will only
   take a few minutes.
   _______________________________________________________________________________

   Display adapter detected : VGA
   Do you have a Color monitor connected ? [Y/N]


   Qinstall then examines your hardware and tries to determine which video card you
   are using.  In the previous example, a VGA card was detected.  Other
   possibilities include Monochrome (which includes Hercules cards), CGA, EGA and
   MCGA.  If Qinstall cannot figure out your type of adapter, we sure would like to
   hear from you about it.

   The next question asks if you have a color monitor attached to your video card.
   Monochrome displays may be attached to some color adapters.  If this is your
   case, reply no to this question.

   Setup questions are based on the video adapter in your system.  The previous
   example applied to EGA/VGA/MCGA adapters. If your system is equipped with a CGA
   or Monochrome display, the prompts would have changed:


   Display adapter detected : CGA

   Press any key to test for video snow > _
   Did your screen look fuzzy ? [Y/N] _

   Do you have a Color monitor connected ? [Y/N] _

          =================================================================



   Early IBM CGA and some CGA clones suffer from snow and flicker when display
   memory is accessed.  When you press a key, Qinstall will attempt to generate the
   snow or flicker on your display.  If irregular, fuzzy patterns or dots appeared
   on your screen, reply Y to the "Did your screen look fuzzy" question.

   Monochrome setups are the easiest.   Qinstall  simply asks you to press any key
   to continue.

    NOTE: If this is an upgrade from a previous release, Qmodem will read the
          existing QMODEM.CNF and skip these questions.


      CONFIGURATION

          Configuring QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is simple, whether you are
          installing QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE for the first time or upgrading
          from a previous release. Seasoned QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE veterans
          should read the section on Menu Navigation and Upgrading from a
          previous release. First time users should go through the
          Installation Section of the manual and ignore the Upgrade
          section.

          Qinstall can be started from inside of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE with
          the Alt-N command.

          The top window is the Alt-N Setup window, which we will refer to
          as Setup from here on. Since this is a new installation, it is
          invoked automatically. The accompanying text explains how to

          navigate through the Setup Menus.

          This text is only shown for first-time installation. Subsequent
          calls to Setup only display the Menu Window. As with QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE, you gave the complete Online Help system by pressing
          the F1 key!

          Items may be selected with two different methods:

          1. By pressing the highlighted letter in the desired menu entry,
             or

          2. By moving the selection bar to the desired item and pressing
             ENTER. To move the selection bar, use the cursor keys.

          Menu entries followed by a down-pointing arrow have one or more
          additional menu levels. When such an entry is selected, another
          menu will be displayed from which additional entries or
          parameters are configured. Since all Main Setup Window entries
          have associated menus, the arrows are omitted.

          While in Setup, the status line always displays a brief
          description of the currently selected item. If additional
          information is needed, press the F1 key for detailed online help.

          While changing to an item, pressing ESC restores its original
          value. To save the change, press ENTER. Changes to the Setup are
          not saved automatically; when done you must use the Exit/Save Top
          Menu Option to save all changes in the QMODEM.CNF file.

          color combinations, customize the colors to your liking and set
          video related Toggles.

          The Monochrome and LCD Laptop entries are intended for standard
          monochrome displays and Laptop Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
          which can only display shades of gray.

          Colors are a cosmetic feature and have no effect on QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE's operation. First-time users should select one of the
          predefined color combinations and concentrate on other sections

          At the left of the screen is a color chart showing all possible
          foreground and background color combinations. To the right is a
          sample of all the windows that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE and Qinstall
          will display. The top of the left window tells you which
          selection you are changing. In the example, the Pulldown Normal
          Text is being modified.

          To select a color, move the square color selector box in the left
          window with the arrow keys. The change is immediately reflected
          in the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE mini- screen on the right side of
          the display.

          Pressing ESC restores the item's original color. To confirm the
          color change, press ENTER. All color changes will take effect
          immediately.

          Color changes must be saved explicitly via the Alt-N Exit/Save
          menu option. If the new color settings are not saved, the last
          color setup will be restored the next time QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          is started.

          When OFF, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE writes directly to screen memory,
          which results in extremely fast screen displays. When ON, all
          screen displays are performed via calls to the system's ROM BIOS,
          and screen displays are much slower. BIOS Video mode must be ON
          when QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operates under DoubleDOS.

          This only applies to the text displayed that is received from the
          serial port. Qinstall and most windows in QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          still write directly to video memory.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is fully DESQview aware. When running
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE under DESQview, set BIOS Video mode to OFF.
          With other multi-tasking programs, you should experiment with
          this setting to determine the best operating mode.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    24
          =================================================================



      Alt-N/V/T/L   Linefeed after CR

          Setting this ON causes QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to add a linefeed
          (LF) character after every carriage return (CR) character. This
          may be needed if text lines seem to overwrite the previous line
          on the screen. This toggle can be changed with the Shift-Tab
          command.

      Alt-N/V/T/S   Snow Checking

          Older CGA display adapters (and some CGA clones) may exhibit
          "snow" when video memory is accessed. If this is the case, set
          this toggle to ON. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will use a different
          memory access method which may help alleviate the problem. This
          toggle is not used if your system is equipped with an MDA, EGA,
          or VGA display.

          While running under DESQview, you can set this to OFF for
          slightly improved display speed.

      Alt-N/V/T/G   Growing Windows

          Controls the method used to display windows on screen. When ON,
          windows will grow or explode onto the screen. When OFF, windows
          will pop onto the screen instantly.

      Alt-N/V/T/T   Status Line

          This toggle controls displaying of the status line (the last line
          of the physical screen). When OFF, the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          status line is not displayed and the last screen line is
          available for incoming text display. When ON (the default), the
          status line is used to display the status of the Terminal mode
          and options of various command windows.

          The Screen will clear when this is toggled ON and OFF.

      Alt-N/V/T/D   Destructive Backspace

          This controls whether or not the character to the left of the
          cursor is erased when a Backspace character (^H or DEL) is
          received. When ON, the character is erased before the cursor is
          moved to the left. When OFF, the cursor moves leaving the
          character to the left untouched.

      Alt-N/V/T/I   Line Wrap

          This controls how the cursor reacts when it writes a character in
          the last column on the screen (usually column 80). When set ON,




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    25
          =================================================================



          the cursor moves the next line down, performing a Line Feed if
          the cursor was on the last line on the screen. When set OFF, the
          cursor writes the character in the last column, but does not
          advance to the next line.

      Alt-N/V/T/V   Video Restore

          When set ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will attempt to restore the
          original mode of your video card to the settings prior to
          starting QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. If you want to leave the last
          video mode that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is using active upon exit,
          set this to OFF. Alt-N/V/T/J Jump Scroll

          This allows changing the method used to scroll the screen. If you
          have a CGA card (the ones that cause snow), you may want to set
          this OFF to see if the screen scrolls more smoothly. The default
          mode is ON to be compatible with the previous releases of QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE.

      Alt-N/V/T/E   Emulation

          This is the default terminal emulation mode used by QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE. When the cursor is located in this field, pressing
          ENTER presents a submenu with the list of available emulations.
          Use the up and down arrow keys to select the emulation you need
          and press ENTER.

      Alt-N/M       Modem

          Modem-dependent settings affect the interaction between QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE, your computer, and your modem. If you use a
          2400bps Hayes Smartmodem (or compatible) attached to COM1, most
          of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's default modem parameters are correct.
          However, the modem setup must be reviewed to insure that specific
          parameters are set properly.

          Selecting the Alt-N Modem option yields the following menu:

      Alt-N/M/C/A   Default Baud Rate

          The Baud Rate is the speed at which the COM port operates and
          should match the modem's speed. Supported speeds are 110, 300,
          1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200. The
          default baud rate is 2400.

          NOTE: With many error-correcting and high-speed modems, the COM
          speed can be set higher than the modem's nominal communications
          speed. For example, the USR Courier HST modem, rated at 9600
          baud, supports a COM speed of 38400 baud. Consult your modem
          manual for additional information on supported COM speeds.

      Alt-N/M/C/B   Default Data Bits

          Characters transmitted over phone lines are made up of data bits.
          For systems which support text and binary program file transfers
          (IE., most PC- based BBS systems), 8 data bits are required. When
          communicating with mainframe or minicomputer-based systems, 7
          data bits is often used. Supported settings are 7 and 8. This
          setting must match that of the software operating on the remote
          computer.

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/M/C/C   Default Parity

          Parity is used to insure the validity of the data being
          transmitted and received. Parity values are None, Odd, Even, Mark
          and Space. This value must match that used by the computer being
          called. Most BBS's use None (no parity), the default value.

      Alt-N/M/C/D   Default Stop Bits

          Stop bits are generated by the UART to isolate transmitted
          characters. The majority of computer systems require 1 stop bit,
          the default value. Supported values include 1 and 2. As with
          other parameters, this value must match the other computer's
          setting.

      Alt-N/M/C/E   Command Before Baud Change

          This string is sent to the modem before the serial port speed is
          changed. The default value is blank. Non-standard modems may
          require a different value.

      Alt-N/M/C/F   Command After Baud Change

          This string is sent to the modem after the serial port speed is
          changed. The default value is blank. Non-standard modems may
          require a different value.

      Alt-N/M/C/G   Cycle Delay

          The Cycle Delay is the number of seconds QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          waits after an unsuccessful dial (IE., a BUSY signal) before
          trying the next number in the dialing queue (or the same number
          again). The default value is 10 seconds.

      Alt-N/M/C/H   Timeout Delay

          The Timeout Delay is the number of seconds QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          waits for a connection after dialing a number. When this period
          has expired, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will instruct the modem to
          hang up. The default value is 60 seconds.

          Most modems feature an internal timeout delay. When dialing, the
          shortest delay will prevail. Make sure that your modem's internal
          timeout value is at least equal to the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          setting. In Hayes and compatible modems, the command ATS7=60 will
          set the modem's internal delay to 60 seconds. Increasing the
          modem's own timeout value allows total control over the dialing
          process.

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/M/C/I   Modem Command delay

          This is the delay, in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second) inserted
          between characters sent to the modem while it is OFFLINE. The
          default value is 0. Some high-speed modems may require a non-zero
          value if commands are not recognized, or if the modem does not
          return an OK acknowledgment. The most common symptoms are the
          modem's lack of an OK response when first initialized, or the
          modem's inability to dial.

      Alt-N/M/C/J   Serial Port

          This is the port number (1-8) to which the modem is attached. The
          default is port 1. For port addresses higher than 2 be sure to
          configure the Base address and IRQ in the Alt-N/M/P menu.

          The default Speed, Parity, Data bits and Stop bits values are not
          fixed. Defaults can be overridden in each dialing directory entry
          to match the settings of the remote computer.

      Alt-N/M/M     Modem Commands

          Modem commands define the text of messages sent to the modem to
          cause a specific action (IE., dial, hang up), or received from
          the modem to acknowledge a command (OK, ERROR), or reflect a
          specific condition (BUSY, CONNECT, NO CARRIER).

          When the Modem Commands option is selected, the following menu is

          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    29
          =================================================================



      Alt-N/M/M/I   Initialization Command

          Default:  AT E1 Q0 M1 X1 V1 S7=60^M

          This command resets Hayes and compatible modems to their standard
          operating parameters. This command may vary depending on the
          modem being used; consult the modem manual.

          Alt-N/M/M/P  Prefix Dial Command

          Default:  ATDT

          This command is used to tone-dial a number on Hayes and
          compatible modems. It is sent to the modem immediately before the
          telephone number to be dialed. For pulse-dialing, change this to
          ATDP.

          The dialing commands may vary depending on your modem brand.
          Consult the modem manual for additional information. If your
          modem requires a 150 millisecond BREAK signal for dialing, change
          this command to the word BREAK.

          Adding *70 after the ATDT dial command can be used to disable
          call-waiting on some tone-dialing phone systems. Adding 1170
          after the ATDP dial command can be used to disable call-waiting
          on some pulse-dialing phone systems. Check with your phone
          company to see if these features are supported.

      Alt-N/M/M/S   Suffix Dial Command

          Default:  ^M

          This string immediately follows the number to be dialed. Should
          your modem require a different End-of-Command character, you
          should place it here.

      Alt-N/M/M/C   Connect Message

          Default:  CONNECT

          The message returned by the modem when a successful connection
          has been established. Most modems will also return the connect
          speed as part of the message, IE: CONNECT 2400. Do not include a
          speed value as part of this message. Doing so will prevent a
          connection if the baud rate is different from the one you
          entered.

      Alt-N/M/M/1   Error Message 1
      Alt-N/M/M/2   Error Message 2
      Alt-N/M/M/3   Error Message 3
      Alt-N/M/M/4   Error Message 4

          Defaults: BUSY
                    NO CARRIER
                    NO DIAL TONE
                    NO CONNECT

          These error messages are returned by the modem when the
          connection could not be established. Your modem may return
          different messages; refer to the manual for additional
          information.

          Many modems can be set to return Numeric result codes rather than
          Verbose result codes. Although either can be used, you should use
          the more descriptive verbose messages. If the modem is set to
          return numeric codes, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will not be able to
          determine the connect speed.

      Alt-N/M/M/A   Abort Dial Command

          Default:  ^M

          This string will be sent to the modem when a dial request is to
          be canceled (IE: pressing ESC from the dialing directory screen
          while dialing is in progress). Most modems accept ^M. If the
          modem supports dropping DTR as a disconnect method, the word DTR
          (Data Terminal Ready)should be entered in this field. Consult the
          modem manual for information on this feature.

      Alt-N/M/M/H   Hangup Command

          Default:  ^~^~^~+++^~^~^~ATH0^M

          This command will cause Hayes and compatible modem to hang up.
          Each ^~ pair causes a 1/2-second delay. In the example above, the
          +++ modem escape sequence is preceded and followed by a 1.5
          second delay. This delay, referred to as escape guard time, is
          required for the modem to recognize the escape sequence and
          switch to command mode. The ATH0^M command then instructs the
          modem to go on-hook (hang up).

          For modems which recognize dropping of the DTR signal as a
          disconnect method, specify the word DTR in this field. To hang
          up, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE disables the DTR signal, pauses, and
          then re-establishes it. This hardware-only method, if supported
          by your modem, is far more reliable than using a modem software

          =================================================================



          command which could easily fail (IE., because of line noise). The
          reason the DTR method is not the default is, unfortunately, not
          all modems support DTR disconnect control.

          Specifying BREAK will send the modem BREAK signal for 150
          milliseconds. Some modems attached to PBX (Public Board eXchange,
          a.k.a. switchboard) require a BREAK in order to disconnect a
          call.

      Alt-N/M/M/R   Redial Hangup Text

          Default:  RING

          This message text, when received, will cause QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE to stop dialing immediately. If you are sharing a voice
          line with your modem, this allows you to answer the phone
          personally. If your modem is connected to its own dedicated phone
          line, this field can be left blank.

      Alt-N/M/P     Port Addresses

          Port addresses are hardware-dependent values which define the
          computer's communications ports. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE allows you
          to define up to eight communication ports (COM1 through COM8).
          Two COM ports (COM1 and COM2) are standard for most IBM PC, XT,
          AT, PS/2 and compatible machines. This does not mean that all
          machines have both ports. These are optional. You still have to
          verify which ports you have available.

          An internal modem takes up a COM port. If you have two ports in
          your machine (COM1 and COM2), you CANNOT set the internal modem
          to either COM1 or COM2 and expect it to work. You should set the
          internal modem to the first available port. (in this example, it
          should be configured for COM3)

          Because it is possible to install an internal modem or additional
          serial port so that it shares an IRQ with another device, you
          should declare all the installed serial ports in QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE. This allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to disable other ports
          that may conflict with the port you are trying to use. If a port
          is disabled, it will be enabled if you exit QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          or select another port with Alt-K.

      Alt-N/M/P/ A-H   COMx Base Address

          These are the computer's COM port hardware addresses. QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE supports default assignments for two serial ports,
          COM1: and COM2:. For PC/XT/AT and compatibles equipped with
          IBM-standard adapters, the port address and IRQ assignments need
          not be changed.

          Non-PS/2 computers can address COM3: through COM8:. Internal
          modems usually have the following Base Address assignments:

             Port      Base      IRQ
             Number    Address
             COM3      3E8       4
             COM4      2E8       3

          Be sure to read your manual that comes with your internal modem
          to verify these setting.

          CAUTION: If you intend to install an internal modem as COM3 or
          COM4, and it is going in a computer that is not EISA or MC




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    33
          =================================================================



          bussed, then try to set the IRQ to a value other than 4 or 3. On
          an AT, try 5 or 2. Not all internal modems allow you to change
          the IRQ and this may not apply to you. If you cannot set an IRQ
          other than 4 or 3, then be aware that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will
          disable COM1 or COM2 while you are using the modem. (IE: if you
          have a serial Mouse on COM1 and your internal modem is set for
          COM3, then the mouse will be disabled while in QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE.

          IBM PS/2 computers also support COM3: through COM8: with the
          following assignments:

             Port      Base      IRQ
             Number    Address
             COM3      3220      3
             COM4      3228      3
             COM5      4220      3
             COM6      4228      3
             COM7      5220      3
             COM8      5228      3

          On non-PS/2 machines, port assignments above COM2 are
          non-standard. Refer to the adapter or internal modem's
          documentation for specific hardware information.

      Alt-N/M/P/ I-P   COMx IRQ

          The IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest) value must be known for the serial
          ports to be accessed. When specifying Base addresses for
          non-standard COM ports, you must also set the correct IRQ values.
          Failure to set the IRQ will prevent QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE from
          accessing the COM port and will make communications impossible.
          (You also stand a good chance of locking up your computer!

          Refer to the previous example for setting up a PS/2 COM3: or
          COM4: board.

      Alt-N/M/Q     Quick Modem Config

          This is probably the single most wanted feature in a
          communication program... A method to quickly configure your new
          modem to work! It's not like the old days where we had just a
          handful of modem commands and everybody knew them by heart.

          Now we have High-Speed modems with things like MNP and V.32 and
          V.42 and Speed Buffering and on and on and so forth. Each modem
          maker that enhanced upon the Hayes standard had to come up with
          their own new commands. To add to the confusion, some have the
          same command(s), but mean different things to different modems!

          Enter Quick Modem Config! It takes the worry and confusion out of
          setting up your complex modem. Everything in the modem and QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE is setup all at once with a minimum of user
          intervention. Like the commercial said, "Set it, and forget it."

          The heart of Quick Modem Config (herein called QMC) is the
          QMODEM.MDF file. This is the Modem Definition File that QMC uses
          to configure your modem and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. As new modems
          are added to the MDF file, we post the new version on our BBS.

          Your list of modems may differ -- more modem types may have been
          added since this manual went to print.

          This is another Pick List. You move the Scrollbar to highlight
          your modem from the list and press ENTER. If your modem does not
          appear in the list, call us. We may have added it to the MDF file
          and have it posted for download. In the meantime, you can
          probably use one of the Generic entries to get you going.

          Depending on the modem, there are up to 4 different windows that
          may pop up during the process.

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/M/T/X   Xon/Xoff Flow Control

          Xon/Xoff is a software flow control protocol used during normal
          text and ASCII transmissions. This toggle can also be changed
          from terminal mode with the Alt-Z command.

          XOFF and XON are ^S (Ctrl-S) and ^Q (Ctrl-Q) characters,
          respectively. Most BBS and mainframe systems use XOFF and XON as
          a method of pacing text data transmissions. If the XON/XOFF
          toggle is ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will send the XOFF character
          when its receive buffer is almost full, and will display the
          following message on the Status line:

          Buffer FULL - Keyboard Input Suspended - Please Wait

          As text is displayed, the receive buffer empties and can accept
          more data. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE then sends the XON character to
          resume transmission and restores the normal status line.

          The XON/XOFF software flow control is not used during Binary file
          transfer protocols.

      Alt-N/M/T/C   CTS/RTS Flow Control

          When set to ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE implements hardware
          handshaking between the modem and computer. This is required for
          high-speed and error-correcting modems. Since additional signals
          are required to implement hardware handshaking, make sure that
          your external modem cable (if any) supports the CTS and RTS
          signal lines.

      Alt-N/M/T/W   CTS when Writing

          This toggles controls CTS/RTS hardware flow control when writing
          to disk during a binary file download. When this toggle is OFF,
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE drops the RTS signal while writing data to
          the disk, and raises RTS after the data has been written.

          When this toggle is ON, the RTS signal remains on during the disk
          writes. This allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to overlap disk and
          serial port activity while downloading data on systems equipped
          with hardware-handshaking modems (IE, high-speed or MNP modems).
          For this option to work properly, the Alt-N/M/T/C flag must be
          ON.

          Normally, the RTS (Request To Send) signal line is dropped low
          (turned off) whenever a block of data is being written to disk.
          This stops the modem from sending data to the computer during
          that time, which could cause data loss due to a missed interrupt.

          =================================================================



          If your computer and hard disk are fast enough, you can gain a
          small but measurable increase in download speed by using this
          option.

          If you are downloading across a network to a file server drive,
          it is strongly recommended that you do NOT use this option.

      Alt-N/M/T/F   FIFO during Shell

          This toggle only applies to systems with serial adapters equipped
          with a 16550 or 16550A UART, which feature a First-In, First-Out
          (FIFO) data buffer. When ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE leaves the
          16550/16550A UART in FIFO mode. When OFF, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          disables the FIFO buffer, and the 16550x UART runs in 16450
          compatibility mode.

          Some external transfer protocols may require this toggle to be
          OFF for correct operation. If your external transfer program
          aborts immediately upon startup, try setting this to OFF and
          execute the external again.

          This toggle only works if QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE detects the
          16550/16550A UART in your system at startup.

          In testing QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, FIFO buffer operation improved
          performance in systems running under DesqView and equipped with
          high-speed modems.

          Problems may occur when upgrading from an 8250 or 16450 UART to
          the newer 16550/16550A chips. While they are pin-compatible, the
          16550 series are a superset of the older chips and require
          additional connections not used in the older components. Some
          serial adapters made specifically for the older chips may not be
          able to operate properly with the newer chips.

      Alt-N/M/T/L   Lock DTE Baud Rate

          When set to OFF, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will set the serial port
          speed to the connect speed identified in the modem's CONNECT
          message. When ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE maintains the serial port
          speed defined in the phone book entry being dialed.

      Alt-N/M/T/H   High Speed Xmit

          When set ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE uses an interrupt driven
          transmit routine for better performance. When set OFF, a "brute
          force" method of sending data is used (and as such, is a tad
          slower). Some UART-CPU combinations may not be able to handle the
          faster ON mode and you should leave this set OFF.

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/M/T/1   16550 UART Enable

          When set ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE enables the 16550 (and 16550A)
          FIFO Buffer for both transmit and receive. We can't imagine why
          you would want to disable this feature if you have the 16550, but
          here is the toggle anyway.

      Alt-N/M/T/I   Init Ignores CD

          When set ON, the Modem Init String (Alt-N/M/M/I) will be sent on
          startup regardless of the detection of a Carrier. Some modems
          always default to reporting Carrier Detected (CD) until told to
          report the true state of carrier. Unfortunately, this causes a
          catch-22. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE paused asking whether or not to
          send the Modem Init if Carrier was present, and the Modem Init
          String may have a command to override this. If you have such a
          modem, you will surely appreciate this switch!

          you exchange many files with remote computers, you may want to
          assign the same directory for uploads and downloads.

      Alt-N/D/S     Scripts

          The drive:\directory path which will be searched for all QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE script files. If this directory is not defined
          correctly, scripts files will not be accessible.

      Alt-N/D/W     SWAP

          The drive:\directory path where the Shell to DOS will write a
          SWAP file if there is insufficient EMS memory, or EMS has been
          disabled (via Alt-N/O/R/E). If left blank, then the current
          drive:\directory will be used.

          The filename created is called QMODEM.$$$ and is marked
          Read-Only/Hidden. This is to remove temptation to delete the file
          while shelled to DOS. Doing so will likely cause a lockup.

      Alt-N/D/1     1st Batch
      Alt-N/D/2     2nd Batch
      Alt-N/D/3     3rd Batch

          These three drive:\directories are the defaults for the Alt-6,
          Batch Entry Window. This is to save time if you are always doing
          Batch Uploads from the same directory or directories. For more
          information on how they are used, refer to the Alt-6 command.

      Alt-N/D/A     Alt-W Pick

          This is the default drive:\directory\picture-mask for the Alt-W
          command. You can set the default to your download directory, your
          word processor documents directory or even your spreadsheet WKS
          directory.

          An example might be: C:\WORD\DOCS\*.DOC

          The above are all DEFAULT directories. Uploads, downloads, and
          script commands all use the standard File Allocation Window (FAW)
          which allows directory specifications to be changed before the
          commands are executed.

          The Batch directories can also be overridden in the Batch Entry
          Window (BEW) at runtime.

          The QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Host mode operates as a mini Bulletin
          Board System, complete with electronic messages, sysop chat, and
          file transfer capabilities.

      Alt-N/H/T     Type of System

          Press ENTER to cycle through the 3 possible settings: OPEN,
          CLOSED and CALLBACK.

          An OPEN system is easiest to setup and get running. As new
          callers log in, the Host Password (.PWD) file is automatically
          updated. All new users are assigned a security level of 0 (zero).

          In a CLOSED system, authorized callers' names and passwords must
          be defined in the Password file before callers are given access.
          If the caller's name is not on file, the Host issues a polite
          "Sorry, this is a closed system" message and hangs up.

          CALLBACK mode is similar to a CLOSED system in that it requires
          the callers' name and passwords to be in the Password file. In
          addition, CALLBACK requires that the callers' DATA Phone Number
          also be on file. When callers log on successfully, they will be
          instructed to hang up and place their modem into Auto-Answer




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    43
          =================================================================



          mode. The Host will then hang up and immediately dial the
          caller's data phone number. CALLBACK is a very secure system
          since it insures that all communications originate from known
          locations.

      Alt-N/H/D     Download Dir

          This is the Host Mode equivalent of the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          default download directory. Any valid DOS directory may be
          entered in this field. All files available for download from the
          Host must be stored in this directory. The Host "File List"
          command will produce a list of the files in this directory.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\HOSTDIR\

      Alt-N/H/U     Upload Dir

          This is the Host equivalent of the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE default
          upload directory. Any valid DOS directory may be entered in this
          field. All uploaded files will be stored into this directory. If
          the Upload and Download directories are the same, all uploaded
          files become public and are available for download.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\HOSTDIR\UPLOADS\

      Alt-N/H/M     Maximum Time

          This defines the maximum time allowed per call, in minutes. The
          default value is 60 minutes, or 1 hour. The maximum time allowed
          is 999 minutes (16 hours 39 minutes).

      Alt-N/H/O     DOS Password

          The password required to "Drop to DOS" from remote. If this field
          is left blank, all callers may drop to DOS.

      Alt-N/H/S     Shutdown Password

          Used to restrict access to the Host Shutdown command. It is
          strongly recommended that the Shutdown Password be unique and
          given out only to your most trusted friends. If the correct
          password is entered, the system hangs up immediately and Host
          mode is terminated.

      Alt-N/H/I     Init Command

          This command string is sent to the modem each time Host mode is
          initialized and after each call. The Host Initialization string
          should set Verbose result codes (Q0V1), no Auto-Answer (S0=0),




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    44
          =================================================================



          and on hook waiting for call (H0). The commands in parentheses
          are valid for Hayes and compatible modems.

      Alt-N/H/A     Answer Command

          The Answer Command string is sent to the modem when an incoming
          call (RING) is detected. For Hayes and compatible modems, use the
          "ATA^M" command.

      Alt-N/H/K     OK Message

          The modem returns an "OK" message when the last command was
          received and executed successfully. For Hayes and compatible
          modems, use "OK". For modems which do not return a response to
          the Initialization command, leave this field blank.

      Alt-N/H/R     Ring Detect

          When an incoming call is detected by the modem, it returns a
          special "Ring Detect" message. For Hayes and compatible modems,
          this is the word "RING". When the ring detect message is
          received, the Host sends the Answer Command to the modem.

      Alt-N/H/B     Busy Command

          This allows you to place the modem Off-hook when you log in as
          the local Sysop. Your phone line will return a busy signal
          preventing callers from connecting to the host system.

      Alt-N/H/#     # Rings and Answer

          This is exactly what it sounds like. The Answer command is sent
          after it received this many Ring Detect message. In layman terms,
          it counts the number of RINGS and then answers.

          The Protocols section allows you to customize QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE by adding additional external transfer protocols. These
          protocols can then be called from an upload or download and used
          as if it were built into QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. The ASCII Options
          are used for customizing the built-in ASCII transfer protocol.
          The Toggles menu handles Internal transfer protocol specifics.

          The following fields must be defined for each external protocol:

      Alt-N/P/x/S   Select Character

          The letter or digit used to select this protocol for a file
          transfer.

          Characters A,X,C,R,O,Y,F,G and Z are internal protocol
          definitions. If you define an external protocol with one of these
          letters, it will disable the internal protocol.

      Alt-N/P/x/P   Protocol

          The written name of the protocol as it will appear in the
          upload/download Protocol Selection Window.

      Alt-N/P/x/U   Upload BAT

          The name of the upload batch file for the external protocol. In
          addition, be aware that four batch file parameters are passed as
          %1, %2, %3, and %4.

          %1 Serial Port speed.  (Computer to Modem)

          %2 Serial Port #       (Current COM Port number)

          %3 Connect MSG speed   (as reported by Modem, CONNECT xxxxx)

          %4 Filename            (if required. otherwise blank)

      Alt-N/P/x/D   Download BAT

          The name of the download batch file for the external protocol.
          The same batch file parameters that are passed in the Upload
          Batch file are also passed to the Download Bat file.

      Alt-N/P/x/F   Filename Prompt

          Specify "N" for external protocols which include filename as part
          of the transferred data (IE, Zmodem), and "Y" for protocols which
          must know the name of the file being received. When "Y" is
          specified, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE passes the filename to the
          download batch file as the 4th command-line parameter (%4).

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE passes the COM Speed, Serial Port #,
          current DTE Baud rate and the optional Filename to the protocol
          batch file as parameters %1, %2, %3 and %4 respectively.

          Installing an external protocol

          Because of their changing nature, and to insure that you use the
          latest versions, external protocol drivers are not distributed
          with QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. We will use Zmodem as an example to
          illustrate the various steps required in installing an external
          protocol.

          Files you will need:

          1. The DSZ.COM program. Usually found on most BBS's as
             DSZmmdd.ARC. "mmdd" represent the release date of the current
             release.

             In the case of DSZ, new releases can appear on a daily or
             weekly basis; the one you downloaded today may be obsolete
             tomorrow.

          2. The RZ.BAT (Receive Zmodem) batch file, used for Zmodem
             downloads.

          3. The SZ.BAT (Send Zmodem) batch file, used for Zmodem
             downloads.

          4. The DSZ.DOC documentation file without which you will be
             lost.

          You may now select the first unassigned entry in the Alt-N/P
          menu. The Revise window will be displayed. Edit the fields to
          make the above example.

          Next, edit the RZ.BAT file as follows, using the QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE Internal Editor (or your own favorite):

          Echo OFF
          DSZ port %2 handshake on rz c:\qmodem\download

          The download directory specified in the DSZ command line should
          match the download directory defined in the Alt-N/D/D setup menu.
          If none is specified, the file will be saved in the current
          directory.

          Edit the SZ.BAT file as follows:

          Echo OFF DSZ port %2 handshake on sz %4

          One last step... Make sure the DSZ.COM program is in your QMODEM
          directory or in a directory in the DOS PATH= so it is accessible
          by QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          Installation of other external protocols is similar. Refer to the
          protocol documentation to insure that upload and download batch
          file commands are coded correctly.

      Alt-N/P/A     ASCII Options

          The ASCII Options are used to define the parameter which control
          ASCII (text) file transfers.

      Alt-N/P/A/R/U Use INPUT Translate Table

          When ON, all incoming data will be translated. Translation
          criteria are defined in the Alt-A INPUT Translate Table. If this
          parameter is OFF, the data is not translated and is received
          exactly as it was sent.

      Alt-N/P/A/R/C Carriage Return Handling

          This option has three setting:

          No special treatment of the CR. (Decimal 13) STRIP All CR's are
          removed from the file as it is saved. ADD LF Adds a trailing LF
          (Decimal 10) after each CR.

          STRIP     All LF's are removed from the file as it is saved. 
          ADD CR    Adds a CR (Decimal 13) before each LF.

          Example: Lines of data sent by a Mainframe end with a single LF
          (linefeed). You wish to save the data to a file and edit it with
          an editor or word processor. In this case, a carriage return

          are defined in the Alt-A OUTPUT Translate table. When OFF, the

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/P/A/T/P Pacing Speed

          Pacing controls the speed of the data transfer to the remote
          computer. If the remote computer is able to receive text data at
          high speed, this value should be zero, the default. If you
          experience problems sending ASCII data without any pacing, insert
          a delay between each transmitted character by increasing the
          Pacing Speed value. Pacing Speed is expressed in milliseconds
          (1000 = 1 second). 25 milliseconds (1/40 sec) is a good starting
          value.

      Alt-N/P/A/T/A Pacing Character

          If a pacing character is specified, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will
          wait until that character is received before it sends the next
          line of text. If NONE is specified, the transfer will not pause
          between lines of text. Use this only when you are sure that the
          remote system always prompts for each line of text with the same
          character. To change the setting, use the Up and Down arrow keys
          to move through the ASCII character set and press ENTER when the
          desired character is displayed.

          In some cases, you may want to control transmission pacing
          yourself. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE allows you to do just that by
          setting the pacing character to ASCII 255 (or any other character
          which you know will not be received by the other system). When
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE pauses after sending each line, press any
          key to send the next line. Repeat this procedure until the entire
          file has been transmitted.

          See also: End Of Line Character.

      Alt-N/P/A/T/B Blank Line Expansion

          This option controls whether or not blank lines (lines which only
          contain a CR and/or LF and no other text) should be expanded to
          include at least one SPACE as a leading character.

          Many online systems and BBS's interpret a blank line, as defined
          above, as an end-of-message indication. If your text contains
          blank lines, the first one will cause the other system to stop
          receiving message text, issue an end-of-message prompt, and wait
          for your input. Since additional message text is still being
          sent, unpredictable results can occur. Setting Blank Line
          Expansion ON will eliminate this problem.

      Alt-N/P/A/T/E End Of Line Character

          Often referred to as EOL, this is the character that your text
          editor uses as the last character in a line. Most often (IE.,
          with the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Internal Editor), this is a
          LineFeed character (ASCII 10), which is usually preceded by a
          Carriage Return (ASCII 13). If your text editor or word processor
          uses a different EOL character, you should define it here.

          Setting this value incorrectly results in a jerky or incomplete
          transmission.

          Example:

          You want to upload a message to your local BBS system. The
          message text was created with the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Internal
          Editor (a good combination).

          Most BBSs start each message line with a colon ":", which we can
          use as the pacing character. Most also terminate message entry
          when a blank line is received. To successfully upload the
          message, the ASCII transmit options should be set as follows:

      Alt-N/P/T/O   Overwrite Files
      Alt-N/P/T/A   Auto-Increment Filenames

          These two toggles work in tandem to control how downloaded files
          are treated. The rules are not that complicated and will be
          discussed in detail. One of the combinations will be the right
          one for you.

          To keep confusion to a minimum, the exception to the rule is the
          Zmodem protocol and will be discussed in a moment.

          When you are prompted for a filename in one of the download
          protocols, a check is made to see if the file already exists. If
          it does, the Auto-Increment flag is checked. If it is set ON,
          then the filename entered gets incremented and the transfer
          begins.

          If the Auto-Increment flag is set OFF, then the Overwrite Files
          flag is checked. If this is set ON, the existing file is deleted
          and the transfer begins. If it is set OFF, then you will be

          =================================================================



          prompted for a different filename before the transfer can begin.

          The Exception to the rule: Zmodem

          When downloading using any protocol except Zmodem (yes, there is
          always an exception to the rule), the Auto-Increment flag is
          checked first, and then the Overwrite flag. With Zmodem, there is
          another possibility called Crash Recovery. This will override the
          above mentioned flags under certain specific conditions.

          If the file you are downloading already exists and the file on
          disk is smaller than the one being downloaded, there is a
          possibility that the file on disk is a Partial (see below).
          Zmodem then attempts to use Crash Recovery to pick up where the
          you left off.

          If it turns out that the two files are not the same, then the
          original rules apply. IE. A check of the Auto-Increment flag, and
          then the Overwrite if Auto-Increment is OFF. If Overwrite is also
          OFF, the file is SKIPPED by the Zmodem download.

      Alt-N/P/T/S   Save Partials

          A Partial is created when the Save Partials flag is set ON and a
          download aborts. The portion that has been received successfully
          is not deleted. If it is set OFF, then any partially downloaded
          file is erased when the transfer aborts.

      Alt-N/P/T/C   Clear Batch Screen

          This is the only toggle that deals with Uploads. All the others
          affect Downloads. One of the new features in QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE is support for Batch Uploads. The Batch Entry Window (BEW)
          has the ability to retain the entered information so you can do
          the same batch upload to several different systems without
          retyping the entire BEW screen.

          When a Batch upload completes, this flag is checked to see if the
          BEW information should be cleared. The default is ON. Even if you
          leave this set OFF, you can still clear the old information in
          the BEW with a press of the F4 key.

      Alt-N/P/T/Z   Zmodem Auto-Start

          Zmodem Autostart When this parameter is ON, Zmodem file downloads
          are started automatically whenever a Zmodem download transfer
          header is received. If this parameter is OFF, Zmodem downloads
          must be started manually with the PgDn command.

      Alt-N/F/O     Online Help

          This is the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE online help file, distributed
          as part of the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE program. The default name
          for this file is QMODEM.HLP.

          If you use QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE from different subdirectories,
          then you should edit this and include the full drive:\directory
          where the HLP file is located.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\QMODEM.HLP

      Alt-N/F/S     Screen Dump

          This is the file to which QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE screen dumps
          (Alt-T) are saved. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE automatically appends
          the .DMP suffix to the specified filename if one is not included.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\SCREEN.DMP

      Alt-N/F/C     Capture

          This is the file where session data is recorded when Capture
          (Ctrl-Home) is ON. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE automatically appends
          the .CAP suffix to the filename if one was not specified.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\CAPTURE.CAP

      Alt-N/F/L     Log

          This is the file where QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE logs all activity.
          The QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Log can be started automatically
          (Alt-N/O/T/U -- aUto Log Start) or explicitly with the Alt-0
          command. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE automatically appends the .LOG
          suffix to the filename if one was not specified.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\QMODEM.LOG

      Alt-N/F/B     Back-scroll

          This is the file to which the scroll-back buffer is copied.
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE does not assign a default suffix to this
          file.

          Example:  C:\QMODEM\SCROLL.SAV

      Alt-N/F/V     View

          This is the path and filename of the program which is executed by
          the Alt-V command. Any valid program can be executed by Alt-V,
          making this a powerful function.

          Example:

                   ³ View          C:\UTIL\LIST °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° ³

          Two special keywords may also be specified as a View option: @FSE
          and @EDITOR. If @FSE if specified, the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          Internal Editor will be used for all file viewing and editing.

          Example:

                   ³ View          @FSE °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° ³

          The @EDITOR keyword, if specified, causes the QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE Internal Editor to be replaced with an external program of
          your choice.

          Example:

                   ³ View          @EDITOR QEDIT °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° ³

          If "@EDITOR" is not specified, the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Internal
          Editor will be used for internal editing of scripts or note files
          attached to phone book entries.

          NOTE: The @EDITOR and @FSE commands should always be followed by

          a space. (as shown in the above examples).

      Alt-N/F/P     Printer

          This is the default used when specifying a printer. It can be a
          printer device such as PRN, LPT1, or LPT2. Or, it can also be a
          drive:\path\filename like the others in this menu. If left blank,
          it will default to PRN (the default DOS printer).

          Example:  PRN

          NOTE: QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will append new data to the screen
          dump, capture, log, and back-scroll files if they exist. If they
          do not, a prompt for their creation will be displayed when the
          corresponding command is issued. File names may be changed when
          these recording features are invoked.

      Alt-N/F/T     Time/Date Stamp

          This toggle does not have a separate sub-menu. (what? for only
          one toggle? nah...) When set ON, the Screen Dump, Capture and
          Scroll back files will have Time and Date Stamp headers placed
          above the appended data. This is appended each time the file is
          opened, not between each line added to the file. When set OFF, no
          header is placed before the appended data.

      Alt-N/O       Options

          The Options Menus define run-time parameters which control the
          operation of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. These parameters fall into

      Alt-N/O/T/B   Beeps & Bells

          Activates or deactivates the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE audible
          signals produced when connecting to another computer, or at the
          completion of a file transfer. This toggle can be changed with
          the Alt-B command.

      Alt-N/O/T/A   ANSI Music

          Setting this ON will permit QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to play ANSI
          music if found in the incoming data stream. This toggle can be
          changed via the Alt-M command.

      Alt-N/O/T/D   Del/^H Backspace

          This toggle defines the character which is generated when the
          [BACKSPACE] key is pressed. When OFF, a ^H (standard backspace
          character) is generated. When ON, a DEL is generated. This toggle
          can be changed via the Alt-1 command.

          Pressing [Ctrl-Backspace] will send the reverse of this toggle.
          For example, if ON, ^backspace will send a ^H character.

      Alt-N/O/T/U   Auto Start Log

          When this toggle is ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will automatically
          record activity in the LOG file defined in Alt-N/F/L when first

          started. If set to OFF, activity logging must be started
          explicitly with the Alt-0 command.

      Alt-N/O/T/K   Keypad emulation

          This toggle controls numeric keypad operation when the keyboard
          NumLock toggle is ON. When Keypad emulation is ON, pressing a
          cursor key will send the correct cursor control sequence, as
          defined in the Terminal Emulation section of the manual. When set
          to OFF, the keypad functions normally.

          Refer to the Alt-G Emulations sections for a complete description
          of the keypad.

      Alt-N/O/T/E   ENQ Response

          This toggle controls the action taken when an ENQ ^E is received.
          If set ON, then the contents of Function Key Alt-F12 is sent out
          the serial port. When set OFF, the ^E is processed as a normal
          incoming character. Refer to the Alt-J command on editing the
          text for Alt-F12.

          This toggle can act as ENQ/ACK flow control. If the characters ^F
          are stored in Alt-F12 and this is set ON, then every time the
          remote system sends the ENQ, an ACK (^F) will be sent back.

      Alt-N/O/T/G   Guard Alt-H

          This toggle controls how the Alt-H Hangup command is processed.
          If this is set ON and press Alt-H, a window will open confirming
          your wanting to hangup. When set OFF, the Hangup command is acted
          upon immediately.

      Alt-N/O/T/0   0xE0 Doorway Codes

          This toggle controls whether or not the enhanced 101-key E0 (hex)
          codes are transmitted. When set ON, the special 3-byte code is
          sent for any of the enhanced keys. When set OFF, the E0 keys are
          converted to their 84-key keyboard equivalent.

      Alt-N/O/T/F/C Clear tags on FKey

          When set ON, using one of the FKeys to tag and dial will do an
          implied U- Untag All command first. When set OFF, pre-existing
          tags remain, and any new tags are added.

      Alt-N/O/T/F/W Write FBK File

          When set ON, any changes to the FON book will result in writing
          an FBK Backup file to disk. This Backup is the same size as the
          original. When set OFF, no FBK file is written to disk.

          This could be very handy for floppy disk users where they do not
          want the extra FBK file written to disk. It does take a lot
          longer to write this to floppy, not to mention the extra 23K (or
          so) disk space required.

      Alt-N/O/R     Options Runtime Parms

          Runtime Parms consist of 6 parameters which can be set ON or OFF
          to control specific aspects of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operation.
          These are similar to the TOGGLES menu and replace previously used
          Command Like Parameters. To change the toggle setting, type the
          toggle's highlighted letter or cursor to the entry and press
          <Enter>.

      Alt-N/O/R/E   EMS for Overlays

          This controls whether or not to use EMS memory in QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE. If set ON, the QMODEM.OVR file will be loaded into EMS
          memory. Also, EMS memory will be used to store the SWAP file (see
          Alt-N/D/S) when shelling to DOS.

          Use of EMS memory will significantly improve performance by
          eliminating overlay-related disk activity. The amount of EMS
          memory required to store the Overlay is slightly higher than the
          size of the QMODEM.OVR file. Other aspects of QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE may draw on the available EMS memory as needed.

          =================================================================



      Alt-N/O/R/I   Int16 Enable

          When set ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE uses an internal Interrupt 16
          handler to access the 101-key enhanced keyboards. This usually
          allows the F11 & F12 keys to be used if they are present. When
          set OFF, the normal DOS interrupt handler is used and you will
          not be able to use the F11 & F12 keys.

          Some keystrokes in QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE do require this to be
          set ON to be used. F11 & F12 have already been mentioned.
          Alt-Enter, to toggle the Status Line information is another.

          If you do not have an enhanced keyboard, or the BIOS does not
          support one, you cannot toggle this to the ON position.

      Alt-N/O/R/S   Share IRQ's

          When ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will correctly share interrupts on
          PS/2 and EISA bus equipped computers. When set OFF, QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE will not pass interrupts on to the previous interrupt
          handlers if any were present. If you are running a PC, XT or AT
          based system, then this should be set OFF.

      Alt-N/O/R/O   Optimum Shell

          When ON, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will attempt to remove all but 5K
          of itself from memory before all shell operations (external
          transfer protocols, Alt-R drop to DOS, etc.) If the EMS USAGE is
          set ON, then it first tries to store the copy into EMS memory. If
          there is not enough free EMS or the EMS USAGE is OFF, then it
          tries to swap to DISK. If there is not enough DISK space, the
          Optimum Shell is disabled.

      Alt-N/O/R/D   Disk Shell

          This toggle works only when the Optimum Shell toggle is set ON.
          If OFF, this toggle has no effect. Assuming the Optimum Shell is
          ON, this toggle controls whether or not the Swap file can be
          placed on Disk.

          If ON, then a Disk file will be attempted if you have
          insufficient EMS memory to hold the Swap file (or the Use EMS
          toggle is set OFF). If OFF, and you have run out of EMS, then the
          Optimum Shell is disabled.

      Alt-N/O/R/C   Calibrate Delay

          Calibrate DELAY When set ON, the internal timer routine will
          automatically calibrate itself periodically. This could be

      Alt-N/O/M     Options Memory

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE allows user-specified memory allocations
          for three storage areas: The scroll-back buffer, the download
          buffers and the Overlay memory allocation. These values can be
          changed to meet varying requirements.

      Alt-N/O/M/L   Lines of Scroll-back

          Memory is allocated as the maximum number of lines which can be
          stored in the Scroll-back buffer. Values from 0 to 1000 are
          valid.

      Alt-N/O/M/D   Download Buffer

          Downloaded data is stored into the download buffer. When the
          buffer is full, it is copied to disk. Each buffer is 128 bytes,
          and from 8 to 240 buffers can be allocated. When receiving to a
          fast hard disk or to a RAM disk, use the smallest allocation (8).
          A low allocation when downloading to a diskette will reduce
          transmission efficiency. Large allocation are at the expense of
          system RAM.

      Alt-N/O/M/O   Overlay Buffer

          The default value is 30K. Increasing this value will reduce disk
          activity during the loading of program overlay files at the
          expense of memory. Anything above around 64K is just wasting disk
          main memory.

          If QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE seems slow, this value should be
          increased in 5-10K increments until execution speed is
          satisfactory.

          Memory available to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE may vary greatly
          depending on the operating system's own requirements, and
          resident programs (TSRs) loaded. If QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is
          unable to find sufficient memory, it will re-allocate it using a
          best-fit algorithm and will issue a warning message to that
          effect.

      Alt-N/O/D/S   Status Windows

          Most toggles or immediate commands have an accompanying window
          showing the change in QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's status. The value
          in this field, expressed in hundredths of a second, controls the
          duration of time these status windows are displayed.

          The default is 300, for a 3 second duration.

      Alt-N/O/D/F   File Transfers

          File transfer errors such as Short/Long blocks can occur on
          high-speed, buffered modems when the COM port rate is fixed at a
          high value. Adding a file transfer delay of up to 20 seconds (or
          more, depending on the system you are communicating with) will
          correct this problem.

          This should be set to a non-zero value any time the serial port
          baud rate exceeds the actual connect baud rate.

      Alt-N/O/D/B   BREAK Timing

          This is the number of milliseconds that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          will hold the BREAK signal high when Ctrl-End is pressed or
          specified in the Dialing setup options. Values from 0 to 2000 (2
          seconds) are valid.

      Alt-N/O/D/D   DTR Timing

          This is the number of milliseconds that QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          will hold the DTR signal low when specified in the Modem setup
          options. Values from 0 to 2000 (2 seconds) are valid.

      Alt-N/O/C     Options Characters

          Special characters and field masks are used to change the way
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE looks and acts. The first four characters
          are more cosmetic than anything. The picture masks are cosmetic
          in addition to being functional.

      Alt-N/O/C/B   Beeps & Bells

          Default:  Single note (ASCII 13)

          This also happens to be the Decimal representation of a carriage
          return so it cannot be accurately represented in this document.
          This is the character used in the Status line to show that the
          Beeps & Bells is toggled ON. 

          You may want to change this to another character to prevent
          problems with the DOS Print Screen function if you like to use
          the PrtSc key!

      Alt-N/O/C/A   ANSI Music

          Default:  Double note (ASCII 14)

          This is the character used in the status line to show that ANSI
          Music is toggled ON.

          You may want to change this to another character to prevent
          problems with the PrtSc function. The double musical note
          character causes Epson and compatible printers to switch to
          compressed print mode.

      Alt-N/O/C/S   Status Line Filler

          Default:  Hash block (ASCII 176)

          This is the character used as an area separator in the Status
          line.

      Alt-N/O/C/P   Phone Book Tag

          Default:  Check mark (ASCII 251)

          This character is used in the Alt-D Phone Book to indicate that
          an entry has been tagged for dialing or other functions.

      Alt-N/O/C/N   Notes Tag

          Default:  Triplet (ASCII 240)

          This character is used in the Alt-D Phone Book to indicate that
          an entry has an attached Note file.

      Alt-N/O/C/D   Date Mask
      Alt-N/O/C/T   Time Mask
      Alt-N/O/C/E   Elapsed Mask

          To allow the maximum amount of flexibility and to insure that the
          DATE, TIME and ELAPSED TIME routines can be used internationally,
          you can specify a picture mask to indicate how a given string
          should be formatted.

          For example, let's say that a date variable contains January 2,
          1990 and you want to display it. There are several possible
          picture masks you could use:

          Picture      Result

          mm/dd/yy     01/02/90
          MM/dd/yy     1/02/90   (note the Case difference)
          m/dd/yyyy    01/02/1990
          mm-dd-yyyy   01-02-1990
          dd/mm/yyyy   02/01/1990
          DD-mm-yyyy   2-01-1990

          In Picture masks, the CASE of the letters is significant. If the
          letter are Upper case, then any leading zeros are substituted for
          the SPACE character. If the letters are lower case, then leading
          zeros are left in place. This applied for both DATE and TIME
          masks.

          Time strings are handled in a similar fashion, except that
          special formatting characters are available for working with
          times in am/pm (12-hour) format as well as military (24-hour)
          format.

          For example, lets say it is 1:02pm and you want to display this
          in a different format. Here are some possible picture masks:

          Picture      Result

          hh:mm:ss     13:02:00
          hh:mm        13:02
          hh:mm te     01:02 pm
          HH:mmt       1:02p
          HH:mm:ss     13:02:00  (note the Case difference)
          HH:mm:sste   1:02:00pm

          Note that string representations of time are always assumed to be
          in military format unless a 't' appears in the picture mask. An
          'e' (em) in the mask should always be accompanied by a
          corresponding 't' (time).

          =================================================================



          Now that you have a general idea of what picture masks do, let's
          look at the characters that can appear in them. The following
          special characters are meaningful in masks:

          Char      is replaced by

          'm', 'M'  Month  (date fields only)
          'd', 'D'  Day    (date fields only)
          'y'       Year   (date, notice 'Y' is a literal)
          'h', 'H'  Hour   (time fields only)
          'm', 'M'  Minutes   (time fields only)
          's', 'S'  Seconds   (time fields only)
          't' 'p' or 'a'      (time dependant)
          'e' 'm'             (usually follows the 't')

          Any character other than shown above is treated as a literal and
          displayed without substitution.

          Elapsed times use the same format as regular Time masks. However,
          most of the elapsed times count from 00:00:00 as a base.
          Therefore, it is recommended that you do not include the t or e
          codes to make it use 12-hour am/pm format.

      Alt-N/E       Exit

          You should always exit the Setup Menu with this option if you
          want changes to be saved in the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          configuration file.

          The Configuration Exit Menu has two options:

          Leave the configuration menu and do not save the changes.
          Pressing ESC while at the main menu level has the same effect.
          This allows changes to be tested before being saved with Alt-N/S.

      QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE COMMANDS

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE features a wealth of commands, many of them
          with multiple options, and used for different purposes and under
          different circumstances. This section of the documentation
          describes all the commands in detail and -- mostly -- in
          alphabetical order.

      Alt-A         Strip/Replace Tables

          Strip/Replace is more commonly known as character translation.
          Translation may be necessary when communicating with another
          computer whose ASCII codes (the computer's alphabet) do not match
          those used by your PC. There are 256 ASCII characters, ranging in
          value from 0 to 255. "Stripping" a character causes that
          character to be removed from all incoming text data.

          The initial menu looks like this:

          Pressing either 1 or 2 displays a screen containing the ASCII
          values 0 through 127 and their respective translations. Since
          character translation is not performed by default, all values are
          the same the first time you use the Alt-A command.

          Above the translate table are the original and translated
          representations of the current value. Characters which have been
          translated will appear highlighted until changed back to normal.
          This is a quick visual cue showing what has been changed.

          To change (translate) an incoming ASCII value:

          1. Move the half-box cursor to the desired ASCII value/character
             you want to strip or replace. The number to the left of the
             dash is the original ASCII value; the number on the right is
             the translated character which you will see when the original
             character is received.

          2. Press the Space Bar once. A prompt will appear at the bottom
             of the screen asking for an number between 0 and 255. To
             strip the character, replace the number on the right with a 0
             (ZERO).

          3. Press [ENTER] to complete the change.

          The original ASCII specification was a 7-bit code allowing for
          128 characters (0-127). All modern-day computers add an 8th bit
          in front of the original 7 to allow another 128 characters. This
          8th bit is also referred to as the High Bit. Pressing the [S] key
          will alternate the translate table display between the lower 128
          (0-127) and higher 128 (128-255) characters.

          Note that although a standard exists for most "lower" ASCII
          characters, this is not true of the "upper" 128 values. These

          =================================================================



          High-Bit values are assigned freely by each computer
          manufacturer. For example, Apple, IBM, and Commodore use
          radically different standards in assigning characters to these
          higher values (the IBM PC uses the high-bit values for the
          international character set, symbols, and line/box-drawing
          characters).

          When you are finished, press [F10] to save the changes (if any)
          or [ESC] to abort the changes and return to the terminal screen.

          If you do make a change, and press [ESC], you will be asked if
          you want to save your changes. Respond with [Y] if you do want to
          save the changes or [N] if you really don't.

      Alt-B         Beeps and Bells Toggle

          The speaker is used as an audible warning when certain events
          occur (i.e., successful connection, or completion of a file
          transfer). Since the speaker volume cannot be adjusted, you may
          wish to turn it off. You can toggle the noise on and off with
          Alt-B.

      Alt-C      Clear Screen 

          This command clears the screen of all information and resets
          default colors; a very useful feature. For example, those ANSI
          color screens displayed on certain Bulletin Boards can utterly
          mess up your screen colors, sometimes leaving your screen
          black-on-black which is hard to read. Using Alt-C will reset the
          color on your screen back to your configuration selections; a
          real lifesaver.

          If screen colors were changed while executing a Script command,
          the new screen colors will only remain in effect until the script
          terminates. Once the Script has ended, default colors are
          restored (but may require an Alt-C to invoke them).

          In VT100 emulation mode, Alt-C only clears the active screen area
          between the top and bottom margins. This area is referred to as
          the Scrolling Region.

      Alt-D         Dialing Directory

          The Dialing Directory can hold up to 200 entries, each containing
          information such as: name, number, communications parameters,
          auto-logon script name, date of last connect, total connections,
          default transfer protocol, and duplex mode.

          Each directory entry has the ability to have "Note Files"

          attached. This file is a standard ASCII text file intended to
          hold all information relating to that entry: information about
          the System being called, hours of operation, Sysop name, and so
          on.

          The size of this text file is limited only by the amount of
          memory not allocated or 60K, which-ever comes first. Entries with
          attached Notes are identified in the Dialing Directory with a
          triple-bar symbol (or Alt-N/O/C/N if you have changed the
          default) immediately following the entry's number. Entry #1 in
          the following snapshot has an attached Note File.

          The Dialing Directory screen is divided into 2 sections: The
          upper section displays directory entries, the current page, the
          number of tagged entries (more on this in a moment), the number
          of pre-defined Dialing Prefixes, and the actual entries on the
          page. The lower screen section displays all available Dialing
          Directory commands.

          If your PC has EGA or VGA display capabilities, or is able to
          display at least 43 lines on the screen, the directory will
          display an additional 10 lines entries per screen!

          What this snapshot does not show is the scrollbar cursor, a
          screen-wide highlight identifying the current directory entry.
          Instructions on moving the scrollbar cursor are shown in the
          Alt-D status line.

      MOVEMENT COMMANDS

      Up/Down - PgUp/PgDn - ^PgUp/^PgDn

          The Up and Down arrow keys move the scrollbar cursor one line at
          a time in the corresponding direction.

          Pressing [PgDn] displays the next directory page unless the last
          page is displayed. Pressing [PgDn] while in the last directory
          page causes wrap around back to the first directory page. The
          same principle applies to the [PgUp] key, but in the opposite
          direction of course.

          [^PgUp] will position the scrollbar cursor to the FIRST entry in
          the directory (#1), while [^PgDn] positions the cursor at the
          LAST entry (#200).

      ^SP/SP     Spacebar Tagging entries

          A number of Dialing Directory commands operate on tagged entries.
          Therefore, it is important to understand what tagging is. We will
          then be able to describe how it is done.

          Basic dialing directory commands such as Revise, Delete, and
          Dial, act only on entries that are tagged. For example, to Delete
          one or more entries, you first tag the entries to be deleted,
          then select the Delete option. To build a dialing queue, tag the
          desired entries, and press [ENTER]. As you will see, there are
          many methods to accomplish the same things, each having its
          advantages. The rest of the commands are there to make QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE easier to use.

          There are three methods used to tag entries; Pressing the
          [Spacebar] or [^Spacebar], the [Q] key, and a third method called
          implied tagging. The Spacebar is the most commonly used tagging
          method. "Q" tagging will be briefly discussed here, but will be
          covered in more detail later on. Implied tagging will be
          discussed under the Deleting Entries heading.

          Tagged entries are identified in two different ways:

          1. They are displayed in a different color (provided your color
             setup defines them as such), and




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                    77
          =================================================================



          2. They are preceded by the special check-mark character "û",
             "Q" or "P".

          "What is the difference between the "û" , "P",and the "Q" tags? "

          Good question. If the Script field is blank or contains a Script
          name and the Script exists, then the "û" tag is used. If a Script
          name is specified for that entry, but the script file does not
          exist, the letter "Q" is used as a tag character instead. If your
          phone entry uses Prefix modifiers, it is possible to dial the
          entry without them by using the ^Spacebar. This puts the letter P
          where the Q would have been.

          "So why the letter "Q", anyway?"

          Another good question. "Q" stands for "QuickLearn", the automatic
          script building part of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. As the connection
          is established, QuickLearn records your interaction with the
          remote computer and creates a Script file which exactly
          replicates these actions the next time you call. As a result, the
          logon process becomes automated. A complete description of the
          QuickLearn facility is included later on in this manual. We think
          that QuickLearn sure beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.
          It is a neat feature, well worth paying for.

          "I now have entries tagged... now what?"

          Now you can Dial them, Revise them, or Delete them!

          Un-tagging an entry is as simple as tagging it; use the Spacebar
          again. With the cursor on a tagged entry, pressing the Spacebar
          removes the tag.

      I, Ins     Insert New Entry

          Adding new entries has never been easier! Simply move the
          Scrollbar to where you want to place the new entry and press
          either [I] or [INS]. All entries from the Scrollbar down are
          moved downward and a new blank entry is inserted.

          When you insert a new entry, another entry must be deleted. The
          phone book is searched from bottom to top to find the first blank
          entry, then deleted. If there are no blank entries, then the
          Insert command is aborted. You have to delete an entry before
          inserting another one.

          After the entry has been inserted, you can then use the Revise
          command to modify it.

      ^D/D, Del     Deleting Entries

          Deleting multiple entries requires that they first be tagged.
          Does this mean that you must tag a single entry before you revise
          or clear it? No, not quite.

          If there are no tagged entries, it is assumed that the command
          applies to the entry at the cursor. Internally, the current entry
          is tagged, then the requested command is executed. This is the
          implied tagging method mentioned earlier, which requires no
          specific tagging action on your part. Thus, to perform operations
          against single entries, you do nothing more than issue the
          command; QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE does the rest. To clear a single
          entry, move the scrollbar cursor to it, and press either [D] or
          [Del].

          Implied tagging cannot be used when multiple entries are tagged
          explicitly. To clear multiple entries, tag them first with the
          Space Bar, then press [^D]. The scrollbar cursor will move to the
          first tagged entry and will display the Delete Entry menu.

          If multiple entries are already tagged as the result of a
          previous operation (i.e., dialing), and you wish to delete a
          single entry, REMOVE ALL TAGS FIRST by typing "U". Since tagged
          entries may be elsewhere in the directory, and not visible in the
          current page, it is easy to assume that implied tagging will
          work, when in fact it will not. It is advisable to check the Tag
          Count displayed at the top of the dialing directory screen before
          attempting any "implied-tag" commands.

          Now that you understand the difference between explicit and

          The Delete Entry window serves a dual purpose. It can delete
          Attached Notes from an entry, or it can delete both the Notes and
          the entry itself. Entries cannot be deleted without Attached
          Notes being deleted as well.

          In the example above, entry #5 has an attached Note. Selecting
          option #2 from the menu would delete the Note file as well as the
          entry. If entry #5 did not have an attached Note and we selected
          Option #1, no action would be taken.

          The menu option you select is applied to ALL tagged entries. To
          clear "Notes only" from certain tagged entries cannot be done and
          requires a separate operation.

          The complete Phone Book is backed up prior to deleting entries if
          you have the Alt-N/O/T/F/W set ON. In either case, the Note files
          are never backed up. Once Notes are cleared, they cannot be
          restored.

      ^R/R          Revise Tagged/BAR

          The Revise command is used to edit directory entries. Multiple
          entries can be revised in a group. Simply tag all the entries you
          want to revise and press [^R]. If no entries are tagged, pressing
          [R] will revise the current entry (implicit tagging). If multiple
          entries are tagged and you press [R], only the entry under the
          Scrollbar will be revised.

          The Revise Entry window looks like this:

          This is one of the several Multi-field Edit windows in QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE. You simply move the cursor to where you want and make
          the change. Several fields in the menu allow popping up a Pick
          List by pressing [F2] when the cursor is in the field. Check the
          Status line as you cursor through the fields.

          Once you have completed changing the information, press [F10] to
          save the changes. In the unlikely event you made a mistake,
          pressing [ESC] will restore the entire entry.

          When revising multiple tagged entries, the Revise Menu will
          display the entries one at a time, in sequence. As each entry is

          saved (or you exit the Revise Menu via [ESC]), the next entry
          will be displayed, until all tagged entries have been processed.

          If you're new to the world of modems, BBSs, online services and
          telecommunications, you might at this point be wondering how to
          find numbers to add to your dialing directory. To help get you
          started, we've included the file WCLIST.TXT on your QModem disks.
          This contains an up-to-date list of Wildcat! BBS systems, sorted
          by area code. Chances are there's a Wildcat! BBS in your area
          that would welcome your call.

      T             Tag Multiple

          Tag Multiple is used to tag entries based on their entry number
          or the text content of their Name, Number field, or Attached Note
          file. In addition, Tag Multiple can be used to add or delete
          Prefix codes from entry phone numbers.

          Pressing [T] will display a small prompt window in the Command

          P[prefixes]#[suffixes]

          A prefix or suffix may be added to, changed, or deleted from an
          entry's phone number by preceding that entry's number with the
          letter 'P'.

          For example, to dial entry #1 and add the prefix modifier 'A' to
          the beginning and 'B' to the end of the number, you would type:

   ³ ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Select Entries ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸    ³

          The 'P' modifier means that one or more prefix codes will precede
          or follow the entry number, and that these are to be added to the
          entry's phone number. In the example above, the prefix 'A' is
          added before the number, and 'B' following it.

          To REMOVE Suffix 'B' from entry #1, we would type:

   ³ ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Select Entries ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸    ³

          Since the 'A' prefix is kept, it is typed. 'B' was not included,
          so the 'B' suffix is removed. Taking this one step further, to
          remove all prefixes/suffixes from entry #1, we would type:

   ³ ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Select Entries ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸    ³

          2. NUMBER field, and
          3. Attached NOTE files

          Each text string to be searched is preceded by the letter 'T'.
          Using the previous phone book example, let's tag all the entries
          in the 319 area code, as well as those using V9600 modems (we
          kept the modem information in the Attached Note Files):

          =================================================================



          The leading 'T' is not case sensitive and text search arguments
          must be separated by at least one space. Also, text search
          arguments may not contain imbedded spaces. The space, the letter
          'T', and the end of the prompt line are text search delimiters.

          Tag Multiple is a powerful tool in the Alt-D arsenal.

      U      Untag All

          Pressing [U] will remove all tags in the directory.

          When you are about to use an "Implied Tag" command on the current
          entry, make sure other entries are not tagged (the tag count is
          displayed at the top of the directory screen). If entries are
          tagged, you may want to use Untag All to remove the tags before
          proceeding with the command.

      Q      QuickLearn

          Pressing [Q] toggles the QuickLearn tag for the current entry if
          the Script field is non-blank. Connecting to a Q-tagged entry
          activates the QuickLearn Script Recorder.

          You can force QuickLearn by using the letter "Q" to tag the entry
          instead of the Spacebar. When you connect, QuickLearn starts
          rewriting the Script for you!

          The QuickLearn feature is described in detail under the Alt-Q
          command.

      Dialing 

      ENTER - Start dialing

          Pressing [ENTER] will begin dialing tagged entries in numerical
          order starting from the current scrollbar position. If no entries
          are tagged, the current entry will be tagged and dialed
          immediately. The Redialer will cycle through the tagged entries
          until a connection is made or you press [ESC] to halt the
          process.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will not dial entries with blank phone
          numbers. Also, the information in the number field is not checked
          for validity.

          Following is the Redialer window:

          The Dialer screen is divided into four areas, each containing
          information relating to the call in progress and to the entry
          being dialed.

          The upper left identifies the dialed entry by name and phone
          number, and the name of the attached Script, if any. The lower
          left tracks the commands sent to the modem and the responses
          received from it. The status line displays timely information on
          the call in progress. The upper right displays the date of last
          connect, the total number of successful connections to the entry
          being dialed, and the number of dialing attempt during the
          current session. The lower right displays the time at which the
          dialing session was started, as well as the current time of day.

          While in the dialer window, the following commands are valid:

          [C]ycle          Pressing [C] cancels the current call and start
                           dialing the next tagged entry.

          [K]ill           Pressing [K] cancels the current call and untags
                           it, effectively removing it from the dialing
                           queue.

          [X]tend Timer    Pressing [X] key increases the dial cycle delay
                           by 5 seconds. The cycle delay is the amount of
                           time the Redialer waits for a connection before
                           dialing the next entry (or the same entry if
                           only one is being called). This delay is defined
                           in the Alt-N/M/C/H setup menu.

          [ESC]            Pressing [ESC] cancels the current call and
                           exits the dialer. Explicitly tagged entries
                           remain tagged.

          The Status message area reports messages from the modem and the
          redialer. Modem messages are returned in response to dialing
          commands and may include codes such as BUSY, NO CARRIER, VOICE,

          and so on.

          Extended responses such as BUSY, VOICE, and RINGING may not be
          implemented by your particular modem. Check your modem manual to
          determine which return codes are available. Modem responses are
          defined in the Alt-N/M/M setup menu.

          The Dialer may return the following status messages:

          Manual Cycle
                 You pressed [C] to Cycle.

          Number has been un-tagged
                 [K] was pressed to remove the entry.

          [ESC] pressed, Dialing aborted
                 [ESC] was pressed, and you are returned to Command mode.

          Dial timing period expired
                 The cycle delay expired before a connection was made.

          Line busy or modem timed out
                 One of the four modem Error messages (Alt-N/M/M) was
                 returned and the call was canceled.

          CONNECTED, press a key to continue
                 The modem returned the Connect message (Alt-N/M/M/C) and
                 is now on-line. If the entry has an attached script, this
                 message will be immediately erased, you will exit the
                 dialer, and control will be passed to the script. If no
                 script is attached to the entry, press any key to return
                 to the terminal screen to view the on-line session.

          Redial pausing XXX
                 The previous attempt was unsuccessful and the dialer is
                 waiting before placing the next call.

          Dialing halted. Incoming call detected
                 The Redial Cancel message (Alt-N/M/M/R) was received
                 between dial attempts, indicating that a call is being
                 received at the same time dialing is attempted.

          XXX Seconds remain until Cycle
                 The current call is in progress. After XXX seconds, the
                 call will be canceled if a connection is not established.
                 The original delay is specified in the Alt-N/M/C/H setup
                 menu.

          Most modems have an internal timer which will cause the unit to

          hang up after waiting for a specific time for a connection to be
          made (most have a 60 second default). If the modem hangs up
          before the delay expires, your modem's delay is shorter than the
          Alt-N/M/C/H setting. It is advised that you set the modem's delay
          to a value high enough not to conflict with the QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE setting. Parameters passed to Scripts

          Prior to passing control to a linked script, the redialer updates
          the values in the following pre-assigned string variables:

          $BOARD       the name of field.
          $NUMBER      the number called.
          $SPEED       the current baud rate.
          $COM         the parity, data and stop bits.
          $PASSWORD    the password field.
          $PROTOCOL    the default transfer protocol.
          $SCRIPT      the name of the linked script.
          $NOTEFILE    the name of the attached Note file.

          These variables remain in effect for the duration of the script.
          For more information on scripts and string variables, refer to
          the Script Language Section in this manual.

          In the above example, 4 FKeys are used as hot-keys. {F3}, {F9}
          and {F11} each dial a single entry in the FON book. {F10} on the

          the FKey definition does not have to be in the Name field. It can
          be quietly tucked away in the attached Note file of an entry too!

      E      Edit Prefixes

          Prefix characters are used at the beginning or end of phone
          numbers (or anywhere between) to add standard and repetitive
          dialing information to the numbers as they are dialed. A prefix
          may be as simple as "Dial 9 to get out" or "Dial 1 for long
          distance", or it may hold a 7-digit SPRINT or MCI local access
          number. When used at the end of a number, the prefix becomes a
          Suffix which may be used to store a PBX access code, for example.
          In special cases, prefixes may even be used to store Alternate
          Dialing Commands.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE allows up to 10 Prefix codes, assigned the
          letters A through J. Each prefix code can store up to 30
          characters.

          In the example above, 5 Prefix codes have been defined. Also note
          that the phone number for entry #1 contains codes E and F. You
          can use multiple Prefix codes in any position of the Number
          field.

          Do NOT define a phone number using its Alpha representation.
          Numbers such as "1-800-DECDEMO" may be a valid telephone number,
          but the Dialer will substitute the prefix values of letters A-J
          in any phone number. For all we know, 1-800-DECDEMO might get you
          connected with Outer Mongolia ($98.55 a minute).

          Make sure that the total length of the dialed number AND
          prefix(es) does not exceed your modem's maximum command length.
          This maximum should be listed in your modem's operation manual.
          Most modems limit dialing input to 40 characters.

          If you have a Hayes-compatible modem, you will notice that Prefix

          codes A, B, and C look amazingly similar to the Modem Dialing
          Command defined in Alt-N/M/M/P. That's because these prefixes are
          dialing commands.

          To use these alternate dialing commands, precede the desired
          prefix with the special character ` (left tick mark or single end
          quote). When it detects that special character, it will use the
          prefix code which immediately follows instead of the Alt-N
          default dialing command.

          The example above assumes a modem with an MNP error-correction
          mode that is enabled with the AT&M4 command, and it is disabled
          with the AT&M0 command. The DT "Dial Tone" command tells the
          modem to tone-dial the number which follows.

          In the example above, entry #2 will be dialed with an AT&M4DT
          command, which enables MNP error-correction and dials the MSI HQ
          BBS (which operates a few HST modems). Entry #3 will be dialed
          with an AT&M0DT command, which disables MNP error-correction and
          dials 555-1212. Entry #1 will be dialed with a standard ATDT
          command which will not affect the current state of MNP error
          correction.

          If you use the ` modifier to enable or disable one or more of
          your modem's features, be sure to set the default dialing prefix
          (Alt-N/M/M/P) to the mode which you use most often. By doing
          this, you only need to override entries that do not conform to
          the default mode. In the previous example, your default dialing
          prefix should be "AT&M4DT". Prefix `B would be used to dial
          non-MNP systems.

          retrieved with a single keystroke. The data is stored in special
          Note Files which can be edited with the Internal Editor or any
          editor of your choice (as defined in Alt-N/F/V).

          To create a note file, update an existing note, or view one, move
          the Scrollbar to the entry and press "N". The Note command is an
          immediate command and does not affect the tagging of other
          entries. When you press "N", the current entry's Note File will
          be edited.

          The following example demonstrates the use of the Internal
          Editor:

          The internal editor screen overlays the command area at the
          bottom of the screen. The current entry's name is shown in the
          editor window's label.

          In the example above, the note is used to store useful
          information which cannot be stored into the dialing directory
          itself. Using this method to document directory entries allows
          the use of the Text Search function (or a text search argument in
          a Tag command) to locate entries based on BBS software, the type
          of modem in use, or supported baud rates.

          The names assigned to Note Files are transparent to the user.
          These names are assigned permanently when the directory is
          created. Note files have the same file name as the directory to
          which they are attached, and their file extension is a number in
          the range 1..200, corresponding to the entry to which that
          specific note file is attached. The name of each note file is
          stored in each directory entry, which allows sorting of the
          directory without losing the Note File linkage.

          If you use an external editor, make sure that is creates standard
          CR/LF-delimited ASCII files to insure that text search commands
          work properly.

          If an entry has an attached Note, a special symbol will be
          displayed immediately following the entry number in the
          directory.

          The Attached Notes identifier can be changed via the Alt-N/O/C
          setup menu.

      V          Linked Scripts

          "Linked Scripts" are executed when a connection is established.
          These are commonly referred to as "Logon Scripts". Pressing "V"
          allows editing of linked scripts, much in the same way as the
          Revise Entry command. The "V" command operates the same way as
          the "N" command in that it is immediate and does not affect the
          tagging of other entries. When you press "V", the current entry's
          linked script will be edited.

          When editing a linked script, the Internal Editor uses the entire
          screen area.

          The Script field cannot be blank for the editor to be invoked.

          Following is a sample Linked Script Edit Screen (using the
          Internal Editor, of course):

          F         Find Text

          The Find Text command is used to quickly scan the dialing
          directory for a specific text string. Entry Names, Phone Numbers
          and Attached Notes are searched starting with entry #1.

          Following the search, the Scrollbar will be positioned on the
          first matching entry. Unlike the Tag Multiple command, matching
          entries are not tagged Also unlike Tag Multiple, you may only
          specify one search argument. With the Find Text command, search
          arguments may contain imbedded spaces.

          Pressing "F" displays the Find Text prompt:

          Remember that the text search also scans Note Files. As a result,
          if the text is not found, the search could take a few seconds. In
          addition, it is possible that the matching text is in a Note
          File, rather than and in the entry's name or number. If that is
          the case, press "N" to see the note file. Don't go off the deep
          end thinking that the text search command is broken; it isn't.

          If the last entry is reached before a match is found, the message
          "Text not found" will be displayed.

      A          Find Again

          The Find Again command repeats the last Find Text command from
          the next entry forward. If no additional matches are found, the
          message "No more matches" will be displayed.

      L          LOAD

          The "L" command is used to load an alternate phone book. If the
          new phone book does not exist, you will be prompted to create it.

          To load a new phone book, type its name (with optional drive and
          path information) in the prompt window and [ENTER]. The .FON
          extension is not required and will be forced on if not entered.
          If the file does not exist, a new one will be created
          automatically using the default parameters defined in the
          Alt-N/M/C Setup Menu.

          All phone book files must have a .FON extension. Should you use
          pre Version 4.2 phone books with a different file extension, they
          must be renamed with the mandatory .FON file type (the filename
          may have to be changed as well to prevent duplication). This was
          made necessary when Attached Notes were added. Since the Note
          Files are assigned the same name as the directory they are
          attached to, duplicate phone book filenames would present
          conflicts. 

          This restriction can be circumvented if phone books reside in
          separate sub- directories as long as the phone book file
          extension is .FON. (i.e., QMODEM.FON)

          The entry numbers shown in the listing are assigned sequentially
          starting with number 1. Since the Print command does not process
          blank entries, these number are NOT the same as the entries'
          number shown in the Phone Book

          Entries and listing numbers will match only if blank entries
          appear at the end of the phone book -- i.e., no empty entries are
          imbedded between non-blank entries.

      S          Sort

          The Sort command, as its name indicates, sorts the phone book in
          one of three user-selected sequences:

          1. By Name field
          2. By Phone Number field
          3. By Total Connects

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° NUMBER-Pick a method to Sort By   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          To select the sort field, press 1, 2, or 3 and then [ENTER] to
          Sort, or press [ESC] to cancel the operation. Name and Number
          sorts are in Ascending ASCII sequence (A), with number being
          sorted before letters. Sorts by Total Calls are in Descending
          sequence. As a result, the most-frequently called entries will
          move toward the top of the Phone Book (higher numbers being
          placed first).

          As a safety measure, the Phone Book is backed up prior to being
          sorted. Should you change your mind, the previous unsorted copy
          of the Phone Book can be restored immediately via the Undo
          command, covered next.

      ^U         Undo

          Prior to any changes, a snapshot of the Phone Book is taken, and
          the Phone Book is saved in a backup file with the same name as
          the original and a file extension of .FBK. The last Phone Book
          backup can be restored immediately via the Undo command.

          When pressing ^U (Ctrl-U), QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE looks for a file
          with the same name as the current phone book and an .FBK
          extension, If found, that file will be loaded in place of the
          current Phone Book. If no .FBK file is found, an Information
          Window will be displayed, stating that no backups were found.

          If Alt-N/O/T/F/W (Write FBK File) is set OFF, this command does
          not restore the backup. There is no FBK file!

      Alt-E      Duplex Toggle

          Alt-E switches QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operation between Full
          Duplex and Half Duplex modes. "Duplex" describes the method used
          in echoing your keystrokes back to your terminal screen. In Full
          Duplex mode, the remote system you are connected to echoes your
          keystrokes back to you. In Half-Duplex Mode, the remote system
          does not echo your keystrokes, and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE must do

          =================================================================



          it instead.

          An incorrect Duplex setting will yield one of two results: either
          you will NOT see any keystrokes displayed on your screen as you
          type, or your keystrokes will be duplicated (i.e., HHEELLLLOO).
          In the first case, you are operating in HALF Duplex mode, and you
          should switch to FULL. In the second case, you are operating in
          FULL Duplex mode and you should switch to HALF.

          Most Hayes-compatible modems feature an internal Echo setting. If
          set to ON, the modem itself will echo your keystrokes. If your
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE settings are correct, but keystrokes are
          duplicated, the modem is likely to be the culprit. Check your
          modem manual for switch settings or initialization parameters to
          turn the local echo off.

          Pressing Alt-E will display a Status window on the screen when
          toggled.

          Check the Status line for either FDX or HDX to see which mode you
          are in.

      Alt-F      Script File Execution

          What is a Script?"

          Scripts are internal QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE programs. QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE features a command language to automate and/or
          time-schedule logons and interactions with remote computers.
          Scripts can be used on commercial services such as CompuServe,
          Delphi, Dow Jones News/Retrieval, GEnie, MCI-Mail, NewsNet and
          local BBS systems such as PCBoard, WILDCAT!, Fido, and RBBS-PC.

          With a script, you need only type a few keystrokes to set
          communication parameters, dial the phone, connect to another
          computer, log on with your name and account number or password,
          retrieve and save information, and log off. Since everything is
          automated, there are no mistakes or wasted time spent on-line.
          When used properly, scripts can save you money.

          Executing a script is a two step process. Pressing Alt-F displays
          the script File Allocation Window, in which you must type the
          desired script name. You will then get a prompt for any
          additional parameters which could be passed to the script.

          Scripts must be located in the Scripts Directory specified in the
          Alt-N/D/S Setup Menu. If the default directory is blank, QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE will as look for the scripts in the current
          directory.

          For more information on Scripts, refer to the Scripts Section of
          the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE manual.

      Alt-G      Terminal Emulation

          The Terminal Emulation feature allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to
          behave like a terminal other than a standard PC display, such as
          the popular VT100 from Digital Equipment Corp. While in terminal
          emulation mode, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE interprets device-dependent
          information so that it is displayed properly on the PC screen as
          if it were a native terminal of the selected type.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE supports 7 different types of emulations:

          TTY       No emulation at all.
          ANSI      Emulates the ANSI.SYS of PC DOS.
          VT100     Emulates the Digital VT100.
          TVI925    Emulates the Televideo 925.
          DBUG_A    Debug ASCII Mode
          DBUG_H    Debug HEX Mode

          To select the desired emulation mode, press the corresponding
          letter. The screen will be cleared and the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          Status Line will reflect the new emulation mode.

          If you are in Split-Screen mode (via Alt-S), you may not select a
          new terminal emulation mode. In order to operate properly,
          Split-Screen mode forces TTY emulation.

      TTY

          This has no specific character translations or function keys. The
          full ASCII character set is supported with the IBM extended
          character set (codes 128- 255).

          TTY does not include cursor control codes or enhanced video
          options.

          When calling BBS systems, the ANSI emulation is recommended.

      ANSI

          This emulation is recommended for BBS usage. Complete IBM
          ANSI.SYS compatibility is built right in. You do not need to load
          the ANSI.SYS driver in your CONFIG.SYS file. Extensions include
          the VT100 mode Screen clear commands because CompuServe can't
          tell the difference between ANSI and VT100.

      VT100

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE supports the standard VT100 functions;
          half/full duplex, set/reset modes, scrolling region, keypad
          application mode, special graphics character set, US & UK
          character sets, full display attributes including ANSI color
          extensions, programmable tabs and cursor control.

          To take advantage of larger screen dimensions other than 80x25,
          you must have an EGA or VGA card that supports more lines and
          columns in text mode. Assuming you have such a card, place the
          card in the desired mode (say, 132x43) and then select the VT100
          emulation. Until changed manually (via Alt-2, Alt-4 or an
          external driver), the screen will lock in on the selected
          dimensions.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE responds to the "Identify" command
          (0x1B5B63 or 0x1B5A) with "ESC[?1;2c" (0x1B5B3F313B3263).

      DEBUG ASCII

          This is a custom Emulation for debugging connections. It
          resembles the TTY emulation with the exception that ASCII codes
          0-31 and 255 are displayed in mnemonics surrounded by square
          brackets.

          The list is as follows:

          Code   Mnem.     Code  Mnem.
          # 0    [NUL]     #16   [DLE]
          # 1    [SOH]     #17   [DC1]
          # 2    [STX]     #18   [DC2]
          # 3    [ETX]     #19   [DC3]
          # 4    [EOT]     #20   [DC4]
          # 5    [ENQ]     #21   [NAK]
          # 6    [ACK]     #22   [SYN]
          # 7    [BEL]     #23   [ETB]
          # 8    [BS]      #24   [CAN]
          # 9    [HT]      #25   [EN]
          #10    [LF]      #26   [SUB]
          #11    [VT]      #27   [ESC]
          #12    [FF]      #28   [FS]
          #13    [CR]      #29   [GS]
          #14    [SO]      #30   [RS]
          #15    [SI]      #31   [US]
                           #255  [0xFF]

      DEBUG HEX

          This is also a custom Emulation for debugging connections. It
          resembles nothing you've ever seen before... All data received is
          displayed in HEX between square brackets.

          A sample looks like this: 

          [61][74][0D][0D][0A][4F][4B][0D][0A]

          This is the result of typing AT[ENTER] and the modem responding
          with "OK".

      AVATAR

          This emulation is a superset of the ANSI emulation. As such, all
          of the above information on ANSI applies to Avatar. AVATAR
          control codes were designed to be lean and mean. AVATAR includes
          provision for packing replicated characters which can cut
          transmission time significantly.

          Enhanced control codes are as follows:

          Codes        Type                    ANSI Equivalent

          ^V^A<a>      Attribute               ESC[n;nm

          The "<a>" is a single byte. The value of this attribute byte
          corresponds to the video attributes used by IBM on their Color
          Graphics adapters. (Intense video is supported, black-on-black is
          not.)

          ^V^B         Blinking On             ESC[5m

          Blinking is turned off by the next ^V^A command.

          ^V^C         Cursor Up               ESC[1A

          Move the cursor up one line.

          ^V^D         Cursor Down             ESC[1B

          Move the cursor down one line.

          ^V^E         Cursor Left             ESC[1D

          ^V^F         Cursor Right            ESC[1C

          ^V^G         Clear to end of line    ESC[K

          ^V^H<r><c>   Set cursor position     ESC[x;xf

          These are 1-based numbers with the row coordinate first. The
          upper left of the display is "1,1." The start of the second line
          would be "2,1." In most cases, the lower right corner will be
          "24,80." Values that fall outside of the user's declared screen
          size are clipped.

          ^L        Home & Clear Screen ESC[H
                                        ESC[0;30;36m
                                        ESC[2J

          Note that the color will be reset to white on black, and not the
          default Text Color of Alt-N/V/C.

          ^Y<c><#>  Replicate Character No matching ANSI command.

          This will replicate character <c> (or any byte 0-255) for <#>
          number of iterations. <#> can be in the range 1-255.

      Alt-H      Hang-up

          The Hang-up command is used to force the modem to terminate a
          call. In most cases, you would not use this command to disconnect
          from the remote computer; you would use the remote computer's
          standard LOG OFF procedure. However, in case you are experiencing
          problems (remote computer lockup, bad line noise) you may use
          this 

          What Alt-H does varies, depending on the information specified in
          the Alt-N/M/M/H Setup Menu. Usually, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will
          send the modem hang-up string defined in your setup. However, if
          you specified "DTR" as a modem hang-up string, QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE will toggle the "DTR" signal and the connection will be
          dropped. And if you specified "BREAK", the UART BREAK signal will
          be sent.

          The recommended Hang-up string for Hayes and compatible modems
          is:

          "^~^~^~+++^~^~^~ATH^M" where:

          ^~^~^~    = 1.5 seconds delay
          +++       = go to Command Mode string
          ^~^~^~    = another 1.5 seconds delay
          ATH       = command to Hang-up
          ^M        = the [ENTER] key

          "DTR" stands for "Data Terminal Ready". Most modems will
          automatically disconnect from the phone line DTR signal is
          dropped for 1.5 seconds. Having the three characters "DTR" in the
          Hang-up string does exactly that. If in doubt, check your modem
          manual to see if "Dropping DTR" is an accepted method of
          disconnecting. If so, this should be the preferred method.

          BREAK is a signal generated by the UART (Universal Asynchronous
          Receiver Transmitter, the main chip on your serial adapter or
          modem). Some PBX and Bell type modems require a BREAK signal
          before they will take action. Again, check your modem manual
          before setting this option.

          Up to 48 FKey Macros may be programmed at one time. FKey Macros
          are stored in "Key Definition Files" with .KEY file extensions
          and user-assigned filenames. Each key can store up to 4 separate
          macros, depending on the key's Shift state (Fn, Shift-Fn, Ctrl-Fn
          and Alt-Fn). To execute an FKey Macro, press the desired Shift
          state key, hold it down, and strike the Fn key.

          The first 14 characters of each FKeys are displayed in 4 columns
          corresponding to the shift states described earlier. The status
          line at the bottom of the window displays summary instructions on
          how to display and/or edit each series of macros, load an
          alternate key definition file, or exit the Alt-J screen.

          To view the complete key definitions for a given shift state,
          press the number (1-4) corresponding to that state (1=Normal,
          2=Shift, 3=Ctrl, 4=Alt).

   °°°°°°° Edit Function Key Entries    F10-Save    ESC-Exit with no changes°°°°°°°

          The Alt-J edit screen features a scrollbar cursor. Move the
          scrollbar with the up/down arrow keys to select the key
          definition to edit. The following section describes available
          macro keywords and commands in detail.

          DOS Shell Macros 

          Two macro commands, @SHELL and @SHELLX allow you to quickly
          access DOS with the touch of a key. Any program, with the
          exception of those that attach themselves to DOS (TSR's) can be
          executed provided enough free memory is available.

          Examples:

           @SHELL CHKDSK
          C:°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will run the DOS Chkdsk program on drive C:. When complete,




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   108
          =================================================================



          it will stop and prompt you to press a key before returning to
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE (and erasing the screen).

           @SHELLX DEL
          *.BAK°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will delete all the files with the extension of ".BAK" and
          immediately return when completed.

           @SHELL ESU
          43°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          If you have a Vega VGA, this is the program used to switch video
          modes on the fly. The @SHELL and @SHELLX macros will detect video
          mode changes and reset QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE when returning from
          DOS. A handy way to use those SuperEGA and SuperVGA cards to get
          higher screen resolutions and larger viewing areas.

          A Dial Macro

          The @DIAL macro is just like invoking an Alt-D/T command. Any
          text following the @DIAL is parsed in the same way that Alt-D/T
          does. For more information, refer to the Alt-D/T section.

          Examples:

          @DIAL TMUstang°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will search all entries for the text "MUstang". The search
          is not case sensitive. The Name, Number and attached Notes are
          searched. All entries that match are tagged and then dialing will
          start.

          @DIAL 1 2 23 155°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will tag entries 1, 2, 23 and 155 to be dialed.

          @DIAL 1 TO 200°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will tag entry 1, then all the entries with the letter "O",
          and finally entry 200. Did you think it would dial all the
          entries in the phone book? Well, not yet anyway!

          NOTE: @DIAL will do an implied "Untag-All" before applying the
          new tags.

          An Edit Macro

          The @EDIT macro allows you to quickly call up the internal editor




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   109
          =================================================================



          to edit/view a file. If a filename follows @EDIT, that file will
          be brought up in edit immediately. If no filename has been
          specified, then you will be prompted for one.

          Examples:

          @EDIT°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will prompt for the filename to edit.

          @EDIT QMHOST.PWD°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will edit the Internal HOST database file.

          A HELP Macro The @HELP macro allows you to call up a Help Screen
          from TERMINAL mode.

          Examples:

          @HELP°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          Something like this will appear:

   ³ You are now in what is called TERMINAL MODE.  This is where you can enter    ³
   ³ modem commands while Offline, and communicate with a remote computer while   ³

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°° F1-Topic Index    AltF1-Previous Topic   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          From here, you could get more help on the three highlighted
          topics, press [F1] for the Topic Index, or [ESC] to return back
          to terminal mode. The most common use of this will be to quickly
          get to the Topic Index.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   110
          =================================================================



          NOTE: When new KEY files are created, the @HELP macro is not
          automatically placed in the F1 slot. You still have to do this
          for yourself.

          A Script Macro

          In the example above, entries Alt-F2, Alt-F10 and Alt-F12 use the
          keyword @SCRIPT. The @SCRIPT macro command causes execution of
          the Script whose filename follows (the .SCR script file extension
          is not required). If the script requires parameters, they must be
          included in the key definition following the script name. The
          @SCRIPT macro, the script name, and script parameters must be
          separated by at least one space.

          Examples:

          This will call the script "TEST1.SCR". Because ".SCR" was not
          included in the filename, it is added by default.

          @SCRIPT TEST1.SCR°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will call the script "TEST1". Because the "." is at the end
          of the script name, the default extension is not included.

          @SCRIPT SETCOLOR 7 1 "String passed to S2"°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          This will call the Script SETCOLOR and pass it 3 parameters.
          Parameter 1 is the character "7", parameter 2 is "1" and
          parameter 3 is "String passed to S2". Since the third parameter
          is text with imbedded spaces, it must be enclosed within quotes.

          A LOG Macro

          The @STAMP macro causes the text following it to be recorded into
          the current LOG file, preceded by the current time and date. For
          more information on the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE LOG file, refer to
          the Alt-0 Command.

          Example:

           @STAMP This will be put in the LOG file.°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          The LOG file entry would look like this (except with the current
          time and date):

             16:26:54 11-20-90 This will be put in the LOG file.

          The special characters "^~" and "^M" have no meaning when @STAMP
          is used.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   111
          =================================================================



          The $PASSWORD Variable When used in a key macro definition,
          $PASSWORD variable is replaced by the current entry's PASSWORD
          field (see Alt-D). Whenever a connection is made, the dialed
          entry's Password is automatically loaded into the $PASSWORD
          variable. Unlike all the other special macro commands which must
          appear first in the macro, $PASSWORD may be used anywhere within
          the macro text.

          Example:

          Let's assume that the word "QMODEM!" is the password for the
          entry we have just connected to and the following was coded for
          Alt-F11:

          My password is $PASSWORD°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          After the connection is made, pressing Alt-F11 would send the
          following:

             My password is QMODEM

          Loading a new Key file

          Pressing the "L" key while in the main Alt-J screen will load a
          new .KEY file, if found. If the specified .KEY file does not
          exist, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will issue a prompt for its
          creation. That's new key definition files are made.

          Alt-K     Changing COM Ports

          The Alt-K commands is used to switch the active serial
          communications port. After pressing Alt-K, the following window
          is displayed:

                          ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Set COM Port ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸
                          ³ Active COM Port is COM1         ³

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° NUMBER-Select a new COM Port   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE supports up to 8 serial communication ports
          (COM1 through COM8). Only the ports specifically defined in your




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   112
          =================================================================



          setup will be identified in the Alt-K menu. In the above example,
          ports 1, 2 and 3 were defined during installation.

          To select a new communication port, press the desired number
          (1-8). Once the new port is selected, the current port will be
          closed and the new one opened. Communication parameters (baud
          rate, parity, start/stop bits) will remain unchanged. To change
          the communication parameters, use the Alt-P command.

      Alt-L      Changing the Logged Drive

          "Logged Drive" refers to the default drive at the time QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE was started. This drive may be changed by using the
          Alt-L command. Pressing Alt-L displays the following prompt
          window:
                               ÕÍÍ Change Log Drive ÍÍ¸
                               ³ Logged Drive is  : C ³
                               ³ Enter new Drive  : _ ³
                               ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¾


   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° A thru Z-Select New Drive   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          To select a new default drive, type its drive letter and [ENTER].

          The new drive will be verified before proceeding. If the drive is
          invalid, a message to that effect will be displayed and a new
          drive prompt will be issued. Pressing [ESC] will cancel the drive
          change request.

      Alt-M      Music Toggle

          Music will be generated on the PC's speaker only if the following
          conditions are met:

          1. ANSI terminal emulation is active (see Alt-G).

          2. The Music Toggle is ON (see Alt-M).

          3. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE receives encoded music data.

          If any of the above condition is not met, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          will disregard encoded music information. To be recognized by
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, encoded music data must conform to the
          following format:

             ESC [ M .....music codes..... ^N

          Music codes are those used in the BASIC language PLAY statement




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   113
          =================================================================



          (please refer to your BASIC language manual for further
          information on the PLAY statement). Music strings must end with
          the Ctrl-N (^N) character. If the ^N character is missing, It is
          assumed that the following text, up to 255 characters, is
          playable music. It might not sound too good, however.

      Alt-N      Invoking the Setup Menu

          Almost all of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's operational parameters can
          be customized. You may change the colors, upload or download
          directory paths or even add an external protocol without leaving
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          To use the Alt-N command requires that enough free memory be
          present. If this is not the case, you must exit QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE via the Alt-X command and run the Qinstall program
          externally.

          Refer to the SETUP section at the beginning of the manual for
          complete installation instructions.

      Alt-O      Changing Subdirectories

          By definition, a directory listing request (see Alt-W) will
          display the current subdirectory. However, the default
          subdirectory is that which was active when QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          was started. In order to view the contents of other directories,
          the current directory must be changed via the Alt-O command.

          When pressing Alt-O, the following windows are displayed:

    ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Z:\*.* ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸

      Alt-P      Com Port Settings

          The Alt-P command allows immediate changes to serial
          communications parameters. Pressing Alt-P displays the following
          window:

   °°°°°°°°°°° LETTER-Select a Parameter   ENTER-Save Changes   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°

          Select the new parameters by pressing the corresponding option
          letter. If an error was made, pressing [ESC] restores the
          previous parameters and exits the Alt-P window. Pressing [ENTER]
          completes the parameter changes and exits the window. For
          example, say we want to set the port to 1200,7,E,1 and the
          current setting is 19200,N,8,1. You would press the letters C and
          K and press [ENTER]. You might be wondering, why didn't you need
          to press P to set 7 data bits? Because when either K or L is
          selected, it forces P.

      Alt-Q      QuickLearn Script Recorder

          The QuickLearn Script Recorder is much like a video camera. As it
          records your interactions, it creates a Script which can be
          replayed later to replicate the session while QuickLearn was
          active. Alt-Q is a toggle; if the QuickLearn recorder is not
          active, it is started. If it is active, it terminates and the
          Script is saved.

          In a nutshell, QuickLearn stores incoming data internally until
          you type information yourself. QuickLearn assumes that your data
          was entered in response to a prompt or question from the system




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   115
          =================================================================



          you are connected to. The last 32 characters received are assumed
          to be the prompt to which you are responding, which will be
          reflected in the final script as a WAITFOR command. In turn, the
          entire contents of your response will be included in the script
          as a SEND command.

          The "Q" tag was mentioned in the Dialing Directory section (Alt-D
          command). If an entry is tagged by pressing "Q", the dialer will
          start QuickLearn automatically -- but only if a Script file name
          is defined and the file itself does not exist --. As a result,
          script recording starts the instant the connection is
          established.

          What if you are already on-line and want to create a script to
          perform a repetitive function? You would invoke Alt-Q!

          When pressing Alt-Q, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE displays the following
          script file allocation window:

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Edit File/Pathname   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          Type the desired script file name and [ENTER]. If the script
          already exists, an overwrite prompt will be displayed. You may
          chose to overwrite the prompt, or select a new name for the
          script. If the script file is not found, it will be created.

          While QuickLearn is active, the status line is changed to the
          following:

°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° QuickLearn Recording Active!   AltQ-End Recording °°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          When you are finished recording a script, press Alt-Q again.
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will display the following status window,
          after which the standard Status Line will be restored.

          QuickLearn saves the state of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE environment
          variables at the beginning of each Script. These variable include
          toggles such as Split-screen mode (SPLIT), Duplex setting (ECHO),

          as shown below:

          TimeOut  30     ; Set Waitfor for 30 seconds

          This sample was created by pressing Alt-Q, entering a script
          filename, and then pressing Alt-Q again to save the file.

          The top of each Quicklearned script contains a time and date
          stamp, followed by the commands needed to restore the environment
          at the time the script was recorded. Note the second line: the
          script may require editing before use.

          QuickLearn also forces a default script TIMEOUT command of 30
          seconds (the last line of the sample script). This default value
          is hard-coded in QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE and can only be changed by
          manually editing the script. The default value is probably higher
          than necessary. Set this value to the longest estimated time the
          script will have to wait on data from the other system; if the
          delay exceed the TIMEOUT value, the script will be canceled
          automatically.

          As QuickLearn records the session, it may capture text strings
          which contain variable data, such as time and/or date
          information. A good example would be a script created while
          logging on to a Bulletin Board System (BBS). Many BBS's feature
          command line prompts which include time used and time remaining
          for the current session. The values recorded in the original
          script may never be matched by the values received when the
          script is replayed.

          =================================================================



          For example:

          WaitFor  "56 min. left) Qmodem Conference Command?" 
          Delay    100 
          Send     "R S NS^M"

          Needless to say, the script will ONLY work if there are EXACTLY
          56 minutes left. Likely, the WAITFOR command will wait forever
          for a prompt that will never come. To eliminate this problem,
          edit the WAITFOR command and remove variable information which is
          likely to cause problems:

          WaitFor "Conference Command?" 
          Delay   100 
          Send    "R S NS^M"

          The " 56 min. left) Qmodem " was removed from the WAITFOR string,
          leaving a generic prompt which will work at any time, and in any
          conference.

          Commands that are recorded

          QuickLearn also records certain QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE commands.
          Following is a list of supported QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE commands,
          and examples of the generated script commands which replicate

          Now that the basics have been covered, let's go over a sample
          QuickLearn recording session. The scripts were recorded while
          calling the MUSTANG SOFTWARE  HQ! BBS Home of QMODEM.

          First, a little advance information: we will call using the Alt-D
          directory with an attached script name of "MUSTANG". The Password
          field in Alt-D for the Mustang entry will be used to link to an
          FKey macro (F10 in this example).

          In the Function Key setup (Alt-J), we must edit the F10 key to
          contain the string "$PASSWORD^M". Once this is done, we can press
          Alt-D and tag the Mustang entry with a "Q" to invoke QuickLearn.

   John, your quote for today is:

   "Two years ago I started with a shareware version of Wildcat! BBS in a town
    that never heard of it.  Shortly following, I quickly became the popular
    BBS in the area and now 80% of the sysops in the area have converted over
    to Wildcat!  It is the users that determine the popularity of a BBS and
    Wildcat! is a hands down favorite.  It is user friendly, fast, powerful,
    easy to set up, well programmed, and well supported.  I've never been on a
    system that matches it."

      Alt-R      DOS Shell

          If enough system memory is available and a copy of your Command
          Shell (usually called COMMAND.COM or 4DOS.COM) can be located via
          the COMSPEC= environment variable or in the DOS PATH, you may
          Shell to DOS. Pressing Alt-R yields the following screen:

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE ®--¯ DOS Shell

          Type EXIT to return to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE!

          =================================================================



          COMPAQ Dos 3.31 was being used on the machine that the snapshots
          were captured from. Your version of DOS and messages may vary.

          You may notice that just below the top line, that QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE swapped 442743 bytes to EMS. Your hardware is interrogated
          to see if EMS memory exists, and if so, how much EMS is free. If
          sufficient memory EMS is available, then most of QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE and the memory it is using is swapped to EMS leaving a
          small 4K kernel resident. The following screen snapshot using
          MAPMEM shows the amount resident:

          Now, if there hadn't been that much EMS available, QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE would have tried to allocate a file on Disk to swap
          to. The net effect would have been the same. The only difference
          is that swapping to/from EMS is a lot faster.

          All standard DOS commands are available from within the DOS
          Shell. For example, you could copy files, format a disk, or run a
          separate program as long as there is sufficient memory available
          to do so.

          To return to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, type "EXIT" and press [ENTER]
          at the DOS prompt. The screen will be restored to its previous

          status.

          Possible Error conditions

          While in the DOS Shell, you may not execute programs which attach
          themselves to DOS, terminate, and stay resident (IE. SideKick).
          If such a program is loaded, the following message will be
          displayed when you attempt to EXIT back to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE:

          A TSR was loaded while executing the DOS Shell and QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE cannot recover. 
          A Reboot (Ctrl-Alt-Del) is recommended at this time.
          > Tap any key to continue <

          At this point, you can return to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, but only
          long enough to save any open files and re-boot the system. Your
          on-line session will not be disturbed and you can get right back
          on-line by executing QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE again.

          FON File Protection

          When returning from a DOS shell, a check is made on the Phone
          Directory (.FON file) to see if it has been updated. If it has,
          then it is automatically reloaded. This feature was implemented
          to allow execution of external phone book editors such as QFE
          from Sunflower Systems.

          Alternate Screen Sizes

          The DOS Shell is also able to recognize a screen size change
          (feasible with EGA and VGA displays), and will adjust
          accordingly. If an external program changes the size of the
          screen while in the DOS Shell, that change will be recognized
          upon return.

          Under normal circumstances, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE restores the
          screen saved before the DOS Shell was invoked. If a size change
          is detected, you will see a Status window displays that says:

                    ÕÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Status ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¸

      Alt-S      Split Screen Mode

          In split-screen mode, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE divides the screen
          into two areas to separate incoming and outgoing text:

   ÍÍ[ Keystrokes Queued 0 ]ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ[ Split Screen ]ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   127
          =================================================================



          The larger section at the top of the screen is reserved for
          incoming text received from the remote computer. The smaller
          section at the bottom of the screen echoes transmitted
          keystrokes. Current keystrokes are displayed on the screen's
          dividing line.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE implements a true split-screen mode,
          complete with a 254 character input buffer. Pressing [ENTER]
          immediately transmits the buffer and clears it for additional
          input. Stored keystrokes are displayed on the screen's dividing
          line. The characters "^M" can be used to substitute an [ENTER] in
          the string.

          If another terminal emulation other than TTY is in effect when
          Alt-S is pressed, it is remembered so it can be restored when
          split screen is exited. The split screen mode requires TTY
          emulation to operate correctly.

          If you use FKey macros, ^M will not cause the contents of the
          character buffer to be sent; the text stored in the FKey macro
          will be appended to the buffer.

      Alt-T      Screen Dump

          Screen contents can be copied to a disk file via the Alt-T
          command. When pressing Alt-T, the following window is displayed:

          The default file name is that defined in the configuration and
          may be changed at the Alt-T prompt. The screen contents are added
          to the end of the screen dump file and are preceded with a Time
          and Date stamp (if Alt-N/F/T is set ON). If the dump was
          successful, a confirmation message in a status window will
          appear.

      Alt-U      Scroll Back Toggle

          The Alt-U Scroll-back command toggle use of the scroll-back
          capture buffer. The Scroll-back command is discussed under the
          heading "Up Arrow" later in the documentation.

          The default state is to have the Scroll-back capture active. All
          data displayed on the screen is stored in the scroll-back buffer
          for later recall. When pressing Alt-U, a Status window is
          displayed showing the new state. 

      Alt-V View a File

          Pressing Alt-V invokes the file viewer/editor program. When that
          command is issued, the View/Edit file allocation window is

          Alt-V can be thought of as a flexible gateway used to browse or
          edit a file. The above example assumes use of Vern Buerg's
          popular LIST program, available on most BBSs. LIST is
          sophisticated replacement for the DOS TYPE command.

          Although intended for file browsing or editing, the Alt-V gateway
          can be used to invoke any program, even WordStar! The program to
          be called by Alt-V can be defined in Setup (Alt-N/F/V) or can be
          changed on the fly. For example, you could type "DEL *.BAK" and
          [ENTER] to delete all the files in the current directory with an
          extension of ".BAK".

          If an external program is specified, a DOS Shell is used and
          sufficient memory must be available.

          Alt-V also accepts two special commands: @FSE and @EDITOR. If you
          specify either of these at the beginning of the command, the
          following actions will take place:

          @FSE uses the internal editor to edit/view the file. This also
          assumes that the text following is a valid DOS filename.
          Following is an example of Alt-V use to edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT
          file in the C:\ directory:

          @EDITOR uses the user-defined editor rather than the internal
          editor in any function where the internal editor would have been
          used, such as editing the attached Note files in the dialing
          directory (Alt-D/N) or the attached Scripts (Alt-D/V).

      Alt-W      Disk Directory

          The Alt-W command is QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's internal version of
          the "DIR /p". DOS command. This will produce a file listing of
          the current directory (see the Alt-W command to change
          directory).

          You are first prompted for the drive:\directory\FILE_MASK to use:

          The default for this is stored in Setup, Alt-N/D/A. As is the
          case with the DOS prompt, you may change the directory listing
          argument, with all standard wildcard "*?" characters being
          supported.

          This is yet another Pick List type window.

          The <dir> entries show subdirectories that can be selected for

          press [ENTER]. The window will clear and show you the new
          subdirectory files that match the given mask. In the above
          example, *.* was used as the mask.

          You can scroll through the window with the standard direction
          keys. Up, down, PgUp, PgDn, Home and End all work the way you
          would expect them. You can also search lengthy entries by using
          Alpha keys. Just type the letters of the file you are looking
          for. As you type, the scrollbar moves to the first entry that
          matches the list of characters. If you type too many characters
          and no match is found, the lower left will clear with the
          scrollbar on the last entry that matched. Typing again repeats
          the search sequence. You can quickly clear the search pattern by

   °°° Y-Drop DTR and Exit   N-Return to TERMINAL Mode   X-Leave DTR Up and Exit °°

          Replying "Y" to the prompt will immediately terminate QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE, close the serial port (and hang up the modem if a
          connection was active), and close the Capture and LOG files if
          they were opened.

          Entering an "X" will cause QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE to exit to DOS
          and leave the DTR line active, which does NOT hang up the modem
          and retains the connection if one was active. This allows you to
          perform any other process, such as run an external program which
          requires more memory then is available via the QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE DOS Shell facility.

          When the "X" option is used and you are on-line, the environment
          settings are saved in a file called QMODEM.INI. The next time
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE started, the values stored in QMODEM.INI
          will override the default configuration, and QMODEM.INI is
          deleted. If QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is NOT restarted, the
          QMODEM.INI file will remain and should be deleted if not needed.

          Replying "N" to the prompt or pressing [ESC] cancels the exit
          request and returns to the Terminal mode screen.

          Data received after you exit via Alt-X-X will be lost. Use this
          exit option when you are sure no data will be sent by the remote
          computer. Most modems and many remote computers will disconnect
          if the connection remains inactive for an extended period of
          time. Be aware of these limitations when exiting.

          This is your last chance. If you erase the wrong file, issue the
          Alt-R DOS Shell command immediately and attempt to recover the
          lost file with a program such as Norton's Undelete, PCTools, Mace
          Utilities etc. There is no UNERASE facility built into QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE.

      Alt-Z      Xon/Xoff Toggle

          Alt-Z toggles Xon/Xoff flow control. Xon/Xoff is a simple means
          of controlling data flow, used mostly by mini and mainframe
          computers. With Xon/Xoff in the OFF mode, a buffer overrun may
          occur on long ASCII text transmissions (incoming data will exceed
          the internal buffer capacity).

          If Xon/Xoff is ON and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE detects the Xoff (^S)
          code, the Status Line will change to the following:

°°°°°°° XOFF(^S) Received, waiting for XON(^Q).  ^Q-Override and Continue °°°°°°

          When the remote system is ready to receive more data, it will

          send the Xon (^Q) code and the window will disappear. If you
          believe there is a problem, you can manually restart the data
          transfer by pressing ^Q. 

          If you have the Status line disabled via Alt-Minus, you will not
          see that you have received the XOFF. If you think you are locked
          up, it is always a good idea to try pressing ^Q once or twice to
          see if this was the problem.

          The protocol selection windows both feature the "F" and "G"
          protocols (Xmodem-1K/G and Ymodem/G). These are "Hardware-
          handshaking" protocols which can only be used if your computer is
          equipped with an error-correcting modem (a modem with supports
          MNP).

          To activate these, CTS/RTS Flow Control must be specified in the
          Alt-N/M/T Setup menu. If CTS/RTS Flow is not specified, or if it
          is specified and your computer is not equipped with an
          error-correcting modem, the F and G selections will not be
          available.

          When uploading or downloading files, both sending and receiving
          computers must use the same communication protocol. Select the
          agreed-upon protocol by pressing the corresponding letter. "X",
          for example, would select Xmodem, which is supported almost
          universally.

          Bulletin Board (BBS) programs each use a different method for
          selecting file transfer protocols. When communicating with a BBS,
          make sure that you have selected the proper protocol on the BBS
          System before making the protocol selection in QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE.

      Internal Protocols

          ASCII 

          The ASCII protocol is used primarily for on-line text transfers.
          It does not support the transferring of binary data such as
          programs or compressed files. Attempting to do so is, well,
          crazy! ASCII does not perform any error-checking, which makes it
          very sensitive to line noise. Bursts of phone line interference
          will introduce stray characters which are not part of the data
          being transmitted. For this reason, ASCII transfers are not
          recommended unless they are used for specific purposes where that
          protocol is needed.

          It is advisable to use XON/XOFF Software flow control with ASCII.
          Failure to do so may cause loss of data.

          XMODEM

          There are two XMODEM protocols currently in use. The original
          Xmodem uses a Checksum method to insure that the data received is
          the same as that which was sent. Checksum is a very simple
          error-detection method with an accuracy rate of 99.6%. Xmodem
          Checksum transmits 128-byte data blocks.

          XMODEM CRC 

          Xmodem-CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking) is similar to
          Xmodem-Checksum, but uses a far more reliable error-detection
          algorithm (99.9969%.). In the event that the wrong Xmodem
          protocol was selected, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will correct itself
          automatically, eliminating the need for aborting the transfer.

          RELAXED XMODEM

          Relaxed Xmodem is basically identical to Xmodem-Checksum, but
          error timing has been relaxed by a factor of 10. In other words,
          it takes ten times longer for an error condition to be generated.
          This protocol was designed specifically for CompuServe
          communications, due to the questionable implementation of Xmodem
          by that On-line Information Service.

          XMODEM-1K 

          Xmodem-1K is a modified version of Xmodem CRC, which uses
          1024-byte blocks as opposed to Xmodem's 128 byte blocks.

          YMODEM

          Ymodem is the true implementation of the YMODEM batch protocol
          and is referred to as YMODEM or YMODEM BATCH. This protocol
          supports the transfer of multiple files within a single session
          which does not require user intervention.

          When using Ymodem, only one filename can be specified at a time.
          To allow multiple file transfers, wildcards must be used in the
          filename for uploads. For downloads, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will
          automatically retrieve the names of the files being sent from
          their respective header records.

          True Ymodem and Ymodem/G batch protocols include "Header Records"
          in the downloaded data. These records contain file-dependent
          information such as name, size, and date/time stamps. As a
          result, file names need not be specified prior to starting batch
          downloads. As an added benefit, the moving Transfer Completion
          Graph is updated during batch downloads since file sizes are
          known.

          When the filename is extracted from the header block, it is
          checked to see if it will create a valid DOS filename. The Ymodem
          header was designed to be flexible and allow for non MS-DOS file
          naming conventions. Apple, Atari and Commodore computers are more
          liberal in their file naming conventions and these need to be
          converted when downloading these files.

          Suppose you are calling a non-IBM BBS system and want to download
          one of their foreign files and you are using Ymodem as the
          protocol. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE converts their filename to one
          that is acceptable to MS-DOS on-the-fly.

          The rules for the conversion are:

          1. The last ".", if any, in the Header filename is where the new
             DOS filename extension will begin.

          2. The first 8 character (or less, depending on the position of
             the "." in step 1) is converted. Periods (".") are replaced
             with dollar-signs ("$"), and spaces (" ") are replaced with
             underscores ("_").

          Examples:

          Foreign Filename    Converted Filename

          STARTER.ARC.STV1.2  STARTER$.2
          ST.DATAKIT.ARC.4    ST$DATAK.4
          ST.SOUND.ARC.1.2    ST$SOUND.2
          A LONG NAME.EXTENS  A_LONG_N.EXT

          XMODEM-1K/G & YMODEM/G

          These two protocols are identical to their non-/G counterparts.
          /G protocols do not perform any error detection and rely on the
          error-correction features of the modems. Modems equipped with
          internal protocols such as like MNP, LAP-B, and X.PC insure that
          communications are error-free. Hardware handshaking via the
          CTS/RTS signal lines must be enabled with such modems.

          /G protocols will not be available unless the following is true:

          1. CTS checking is enabled in the Alt-N/O/T/C Setup menu option.

          2. The modem's CTS signal is enabled when the serial port is
             initialized.

          Make sure that the modem does not force the CTS signal ON at all
          times. This will cause a modem buffer overflow resulting in an
          aborted transfer.

          Xmodem-1K/G and Ymodem/G cannot re-send bad data blocks. In
          theory, there should be NO bad blocks of data in an error-free
          connection. If errors occur, they are likely to be cause by an
          improper setup in either the modem or QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          High-speed or Error-Correcting modems communicate with QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE at the hardware level via the CTS/RTS interface. The
          modem cables used in conventional modems (IE 1200/2400, non-MNP
          units) may not carry all the necessary signals (pins could be
          missing). The wrong cable could prevent QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          from detecting the CTS signal, and ignore the modem's
          hardware-handshaking capabilities.

          When in doubt, use a serial cable with all 25 pins connected (a
          flat ribbon, 25-conductor cable). AT Users may use a 9-pin to
          25-pin adapter with all 9 lines connected, attached to a
          25-conductor cable as described above.

          Zmodem

          This is the popular streaming protocol put into the public domain
          by Telenet. Zmodem uses a variable sized block to transfer date
          over even the noisiest phone lines. Zmodem was designed as a
          Batch transfer protocol. As such, it shares the same transfer
          windows and allocation methods that the Ymodem protocol uses.

          Should errors occur, Zmodem can tell the sending end just exactly
          where to restart. The real bonus to Zmodem is that it does not
          require a high-speed or error-correcting modem with MNP or V.42
          to be effective. While it is not as fast as Ymodem/G or
          Xmodem-1K/G, it does perform well enough to have become a
          'standard' in the industry.

          One of the benefits of Zmodem is Crash Recovery. This allows an
          aborted file transfer to be restarted at a later time, without
          having to retransmit the already received portion of the file. A
          check is made to make sure the partial file has not changed. If
          it hasn't, then it picks up where it left off. It has, then the
          file transfer is restarted from the beginning.

          External Protocols Due to their nature, external protocols do not
          have a seamless interface and operate differently from built-in
          protocols. When an external protocol is used, QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE invokes the protocol's upload or download batch file which
          in turn executes the external protocol's file transfer program.

          Since QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE has no control over external
          programs, screen displays will be handled entirely by the
          external program. The screen will be cleared before control is
          passed to the external protocol, and once the transfer is
          complete, you will be returned to the standard QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE terminal display.

          For more information on installing External protocols, refer to
          the Setup (Alt-N/P) section. For protocol-specific information,
          refer to the external protocol's documentation.

          Download File Allocation

          After selecting your protocol, you have to tell QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE where to put the file and what to call it. If it is a Batch
          transfer protocol, then you only have to decide where to put the
          file. Batch transfers send the filename as part of the file.

          Notice the Window titles. Non-batch transfer want a complete
          drive:\path\filename to be successful. Batch transfer want only
          the drive:\path. Remember, the filename has already been decided
          and will automatically be picked up as part of the file transfer.

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE has the ability to "pick" file names
          directly from the screen. A scan is made on the screen, from
          right to left, bottom to top for a valid file name. "Valid File
          Name" is defined as a 1- to 8-character text string followed by a
          period and a 2- or 3-character suffix. Spaces, semicolons, and
          the left and right margins are valid file name delimiters.
          Following are some examples of valid and invalid file names:

          THISFILE.TXT     valid
          README.1         invalid (not enough characters in suffix)
          QMDMSST.ARC      valid
          PROGRAM.THIS     invalid (too many characters in suffix)
          MPROGRAM1.THIS   invalid (name too long)

          If a suitable filename was not found, or if the one picked is not
          correct, the filename must be added or edited manually. Once the
          desired file name has been specified, press [ENTER] to start the
          file transfer.

          Upload File Allocation

          Uploading files is similar to Downloading. You still tell the

          remote host what you are going to do before doing it. You also
          have to make sure you use the same protocol that you tell the
          host.

          The PgUp protocol window is identical to the PgDn Down load
          window, with the exception that the Free Disk Space is not at the
          top. So, assuming you have told the remote system what protocol
          you are going to use, and the filename if necessary, you can
          begin your upload!

          Once you have selected a protocol, you have to tell QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE the filename(s) to use. The possibilities can be
          simple if you selected a non-batch protocol, to extensive for
          batch protocols.

          The Batch Entry Window (BEW), used when uploading with a Batch
          Protocol, is divided into three groups, each group comprising a
          PATH and 20 FILES cells.

          The 3 different PATH fields are automatically initialized to the
          values defined by the Alt-N/D/1, Alt-N/D/2 and Alt-N/D/3 in the
          Setup. The FILES cells are blank. The three groups work
          independently of each other. By this, we mean that you could
          specify files in the 1st and 3rd groups without having to specify
          any in the 2nd group. Maybe you only want to send from the 2nd
          group only, and that is fine too.

          The PATH cells are like the FILES cells in that they can be
          changed within the window before uploading. You may decide to
          leave one of the 3 default paths blank, just in case you
          frequently upload from several different directories depending on
          who you call. This would save time clearing a PATH field all the

          time.

          Each FILES cell can contain exactly one filename specification. 8
          characters for the NAME, the PERIOD, and 3 characters for the
          EXTENSION. You do not have to use all 12 characters, however.
          Filenames such as YEAREND.WKS, REPORT.DOC, and SOURCE.C are all
          valid.

          To really make them functional, each cell could include multiple
          wildcard characters. The wildcard characters * and ? can allow
          each cell to specify a group of files. Filenames such as
          MONTH??.WKS, *.PAS, and even *.* are valid! In these cases, all
          files matching the wildcard specification would be uploaded in
          the batch transfer.

          Caution should be used to avoid duplication when using wildcards
          within the same group of cells. There is no checking done to see
          if a file matches one or more of the cells with wildcards. You
          could be sending the same file more than once in the same batch
          upload. If the 3 examples were placed in the same cell group, all
          the files matching the first two would be sent twice because the
          3rd example, *.*, will send them all again.

          The status line at the bottom of the screen lists these options
          if you entered the BEW with the PgUp key:

          F2-Pick List  F3-Last Found  F4-Clear  F10-Upload  ESC-Exit

          If you used the Alt-6 Key, you will see this:

          F2-Pick List  F3-Last Found  F4-Clear  F10-Save to Disk  ESC-Exit

          F2-Pick List

          When the cursor is in a FILES cell, you can press [F2] to open a
          Pick List. If the cell is blank, a default of *.* is used,
          showing all the available files in that PATH group. If the cell
          contains a filename with wildcard characters, such as *.PAS, then
          all the files that end in .PAS are shown in the Pick List. With
          the Pick List open, just move the scrollbar to the entry you want
          in that cell and press [ENTER]. The cell is then filled in with
          that filename. You can only tag one filename at a time from the
          Pick List.

          F3-Last Found

          This will scan the underlying screen for the last valid filename
          (right to left, bottom to top) and place it in the current cell.
          You might use this when you have a file to upload, and you have

          just told the remote system about the file. As long as it is on
          the underlying screen, you do not have to type the filename in
          again.

          F4-Clear

          This clears all fields in the BEW and resets the three PATH cells
          to the defaults specified in Alt-N/D.

          F10-Upload

          When you have pressed PgUp and selected either Y, G or Z, and you
          have 1 or more files defined, this will begin the upload. 

          F10-Save to Disk

          This will write out a file called QMODEM.BEW in the directory
          where the QMODEM.CNF file was found. It contains all of the
          information in the BEW. The BEW window will then close. The next
          time the BEW is opened, the QMODEM.BEW file is searched for and
          loaded back in if found.

          ESC-Exit

          Exits the BEW and aborts any changes made.

          Download Transfer Window

          The download window is common throughout all the internal
          protocols, except ASCII. Let's look at the others first:

          =================================================================



          You probably won't find a better file transfer status window
          anywhere! Here is a breakdown of each field.

          FILE         The name of the file being received. If it is a
                       Batch download (Ymodem or Zmodem), then this is
                       filled in automatically. Non-batch transfers allow
                       you to enter the filename.

          PATH         This is the drive and subdirectory where the File
                       is being saved to.

          PROTOCOL     The current transfer protocol being used.

          BYTES TOTAL  This is the number of bytes that is being received.
                       This field will say "N.A." if the protocol is
                       non-batch.

          BYTES RCVD   This is the number of bytes received so far.

          ERROR COUNT  This is the number of errors recorded so far.

          BLOCKS TOTAL This is the number of blocks expected to be
                       received. It is figured based on the Bytes Total
                       divided by the Block Size. If it is a non-batch
                       transfer, this will show "N.A.".

          BLOCKS RCVD  This is the number of blocks received so far.

          BLOCK SIZE   This is the current block size being used by the
                       sending side. It is included because protocols like
                       Ymodem and Zmodem can change their data block sizes
                       on the fly.

          TIME ELAPSED This is the current elapsed time since the start of
                       the download for the current file. Current is
                       stressed because a batch transfer may have more
                       than one file, and there is no global elapsed time
                       kept.

          ++ REMAINING This is the estimated remaining time in the
                       transfer for the current file. If this is a
                       non-batch transfer, this field will be blank.

          EFFICIENCY   This shows you how efficient the protocol is. It is
                       based on the current DCE Baud Rate as reported by
                       your modem, and the number of bytes received
                       against the elapsed time. Roll these all together,
                       sprinkle with a little sugar, and out pops the
                       efficiency! Seriously, if the modem has features




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   145
          =================================================================



                       such as data compression, the efficiency can rise
                       above the normal 100% DCE rate. Remember, this is
                       based on the DCE speed, not the DTE rate that the
                       serial port may be locked at.

          CHARS/SECOND This is a by-product of figuring the Efficiency.
                       When you know how many bytes have been received in
                       a set number of seconds, you can easily figure the
                       Character per Second. To convert this to a baud
                       rate, multiply this by 10.

          STATUS MSGS  Status messages keep you posted on the progression
                       of the transfer.

          COMPLETION   Some people call this the gas gauge because it goes
                       from Empty (0%) to Full (100%) as the transfer
                       proceeds. This is just a quick visual check of how
                       much is complete and how much further you have to
                       go. Each block represents 2% of the entire file. If
                       this is a non-batch transfer, this will not be
                       available.

          Download ASCII Window

          When downloading with ASCII, you do not get a fancy window.
          Instead, the Status Line switches to the following:

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° ASCII DOWNLOAD IN PROGRESS    ESC-Save and Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          The current terminal emulation stays in effect, and the screen
          remains unchanged. Except, all data received now is saved to the
          file you specified.

          Upload Transfer Window

          The Upload Transfer window is identical to the Download window,
          with two exception. Wherever the word RCVD appears, it is changed
          to SENT. Also, because all the file sizes are known in advance,
          there are no "N.A." fields.

          Upload ASCII

          During an ASCII Upload, the Status Line changes to keep track of
          the upload. Following is a sample of a QMODEM.LOG file being
          uploaded:

          The screen uses whatever Terminal emulation was in effect at the
          time of the Upload. The Status line shows the Filename, the
          number of Bytes sent so far and the Percent completed.

          UP-ARROW  Scroll-back

          As the on-line session proceeds, all displayed information is
          stored in a special scroll-back buffer. Pressing the Up-Arrow
          selects Scroll-back mode. While in this mode, you can scroll
          backward and forward through previously displayed text.

          The size of the scroll-back buffer is defined in the Alt-N/O/M/L
          Setup menu.

          Following is a sample scroll-back display:

          Pressing [C] clears the Scroll-back buffer and frees up the
          memory allocated to it.

          The QUEUE at the far right of the scroll-back status line tracks
          the amount of incoming data while you are viewing Scroll-back
          information.

      CTRL-HOME  Capture to Disk

          Ctrl-Home is a toggle which starts or stops the Session Capture
          facility. While Session Capture is active, the data displayed on
          the screen is also saved to a disk file.

          When Session Capture is started, the following "Capture" file
          allocation window will be displayed:

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° Edit File/Pathname   ESC-Exit °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          The file name may be changed by backspacing over the default name
          and typing a new one. If the capture file is new, you will be
          prompted for its creation. Pressing [ESC] will cancel the session
          capture request and return to the terminal screen.

          Whenever session capture starts, a Status window will tell you
          that it has been started successfully. To end Session Capture,
          press Ctrl-Home again. The capture file will be closed and the
          Status window will be displayed telling you so.

      CTRL-END   Sending a BREAK

          Pressing Ctrl-End generates a BREAK signal. "BREAK" is a special
          signal generated by the serial adapter, used to notify the
          receiving computer of a specific condition. In most cases, BREAK
          is used to tell the other computer to interrupt whatever it is
          doing. For example, the GEnie On-line Service interprets the
          BREAK signal in the same manner as your PC would interpret ^C or
          Ctrl-Break.

          In response to Ctrl-End, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE displays the
          following message:

          <<BREAK>>




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   148
          =================================================================



          As is the case with PC programs which disable or ignore
          Ctrl-Break, the BREAK signal may not be recognized by the
          receiving computer. BREAK handling is a function of the
          communication software, and this feature may not be implemented
          in the computer you are communicating with. 

      SHIFT-TAB Add Linefeeds

          In some cases, text lines may be overwritten on the screen. The
          most likely reason is that the other computer is not sending
          Linefeed (LF) characters at the end of each line.

          Pressing Shift-Tab toggles the addition of a Linefeed (LF)
          character to each incoming Carriage Return (CR). To turn the Add
          Linefeed feature OFF, press Shift-Tab again.

          If text lines are double-spaced, Linefeeds are being added when
          they shouldn't. Press Shift-Tab again to disable Linefeed
          addition.

          When Shift-Tab is pressed, a Status window will be displayed
          showing the new state of the toggle.

      Alt-1      Backspace / DEL Toggle

          Alt-1 toggles the value generated by the Backspace key between
          the standard backspace and the DEL character.

          In normal operating mode, Backspace (BS) and Ctrl-H (^H) are
          treated in the same fashion and both generate a Backspace (ASCII
          8) character. Certain terminals, such as the DEC VT100 require
          that a DEL character be sent (ASCII 127) when the backspace key
          is pressed.

          When pressing Alt-1, a Status window will be displayed showing
          the new state of the toggle. The BS/DEL setting can be reversed
          on-the-fly by pressing Ctrl- Backspace. The current status of the
          BS/DEL toggle is displayed in the Alt-N/O/T setup menu.

          If the BS/DEL setting is incorrect, pressing the Backspace key
          will not yield the desired result on the receiving computer. If
          the toggle is active and the other computer expects a BS
          character, it will display the ASCII 127 instead (ASCII 127 on
          IBM PCs is displayed as a little house).

      Alt-2 and Alt-4 EGA/VGA Modes

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE supports 2 alternate screen modes with
          EGA/VGA adapter. Alt-2 restores the standard 80x25 video mode for




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   149
          =================================================================



          both EGA and VGA adapters. Alt-4 switches EGA systems to 80x43
          mode and VGA systems to 80x50 mode. The screen will be cleared
          following each video mode change.

          Some "SuperEGA" or "SuperVGA" adapters also support extended
          screen modes beyond the standard 80x25 display. These extended
          modes can be used if they are activated within QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE with a FKey macro which invokes the adapters' setup utility
          with a @SHELL command.

          Example:

          The Video-7 VEGA VGA comes with a utility called ESU.COM used to
          switch video modes. To run this utility within QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE, assign the command "@SHELL ESU 43" to a QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE function key via the Alt-J command.

      Alt-3      Debugging Screen

          This is used by Tech Support at Mustang Software should you have
          a problem. The details of this window are beyond the scope of
          this manual. Suffice to say, it contains important information
          about your particular setup, and you can count on being asked
          about the contents should you call for help. This is one more
          reason you should be sitting in front of your computer, with
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE running, when you call for help. It is
          usually a waste of your time and ours if you are not.

      Alt-6      Batch Entry Window

          This is the same BEW window as discussed back on page 139. Please
          refer back for a complete discussion.

      Alt-8      Hi-Bit Stripping Toggle

          Some computer systems use the high bit of each 8-bit character
          for parity checking , like CompuServe and GEnie. If the high bit
          is not removed, the screen display will consist of high-order
          ASCII characters (>ASCII 127) such as foreign, graphic, or
          scientific characters.

          Alt-8 toggles the stripping of the high-bit ON and OFF. When
          pressing Alt-8, a Status window will be displayed showing the new
          state of this toggle. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE starts in 8-bit mode
          by default. This can be changed with a Script command to automate
          high-bit stripping, for example when calling Compuserve.

          The Status Line will display an "8" or "7" in the Toggles area to

          =================================================================



          Some BBS's use fancy graphics characters and ANSI escape codes.
          To display these properly, 8 bit mode must be in effect.

      Alt-9      Copying to the Printer

          The Alt-9 printer session toggle is similar to the DOS Ctrl-PrtSc
          command. If your system is equipped with a printer, pressing
          Alt-9 will replicate all screen displays on the system printer.
          To stop session printing, press Alt-9 again.

          When pressing Alt-9, a Status window will be displayed showing
          the new state of the toggle. The printer should be READY when the
          Alt-9 command is issued. If the system is not equipped with a
          printer, or the printer is not ready (IE., powered off or
          offline), QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will display an "Abort ,Retry,
          Ignore or Fail" Error window. Alt-0 Log File Toggle

          The Alt-0 command starts or stops QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Session
          Log recording. The session LOG feature is used to keep track of
          major QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE activity. When the session log is
          active, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE writes an entry in the session log
          file reflecting information such as:

          Who was called
          The date and time of the call
          How long the on-line session

          Each log entry is time- and date-stamped.

          Alt-0 is a toggle. If the Log File is closed, a filename prompt
          will be issued and the file will be opened. If the Log File is
          already opened, it will be closed.

          Some Log entries may take up more than one line in the file. Any
          log entry which starts with "++" is a continuation of the
          previous one. For example, download or upload log entries are
          made up of several records in order to record all meaningful
          statistics.

          Following is a complete list of all possible Log entries (the
          time and date stamps are not shown):

          Entries starting with "[user]" vary depending on the STAMP
          command used in FKeys and Script commands. Both will begin with
          the word "STAMP" followed by user-supplied text.

          Entries starting with "[auto]" are recorded whenever QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE changes from offline to on-line status and vice versa.

          Remaining entries are related to the command listed in the left
          column.

          Since Logging can be turned on automatically, you can now keep a
          perfect record of all your long distance calls. Many other
          important functions of operation can also be tracked with the
          Session Log feature.

      Alt-5      Host Mode

          The Host mode is like a small BBS system. It allows others to
          call your system without a lot of hassles. The Host Mode features
          the following:

          1. Open, Closed, and Callback operation to implement as little
             or as much security as needed.

          2. Support of all internal and external file transfer protocols
             (except ASCII)for both uploads and downloads.

          3. User-customizable menus. Default menus are provided and can
             be modified or replaced altogether to meet users'
             requirements.

          4. Full-featured messaging system: Enter/Read/Reply/Kill
             messages, and Private messaging facility.

          =================================================================



          5. Shell to DOS from remote, with optional password protection.

          6. Shutdown from remote, also with optional password protection.

          7. Ability to call Scripts from the Host. New Host features can
             be implemented via standard QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE scripts.

          8. Sysop CHAT mode which allows callers to converse with the
             SYStem OPerator while on-line.

          9. On-line listing of the HOST download file directory.

         10. Complete online help for each menu option. These help files 
                 can be customized by you should you want.

          Host Setup

          Before it can be used, the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Host Mode must
          be configured via the Alt-N/H Host Setup.

          External Files Required The Password File, QMHOST.PWD, is the
          only file required to run Host Mode. QMHOST.PWD contains users'
          Names, Passwords, Security Levels, and optional CallBack phone
          numbers. If QMHOST.PWD does not exist, it will be created
          automatically the first time Host Mode is started.

          The file "QMHOST.PWD" is a CR/LF-delimited ASCII file. It can be
          edited with the Internal Editor or any standard text editor (IE.
          QEDIT, Norton Editor, or word processors which can edit
          unformatted ASCII files).

          The QMHOST.PWD file layout is as follows:

          Firstname Lastname Password Security-Level Callback-# ;Comments

          Each field is separated by one or more spaces, and comments must
          be preceded by a semicolon. The Callback Number is required only
          if you have selected the CALLBACK system type. Information in the
          Password File is case-insensitive ("JANE", "Jane", and "jane" are
          interpreted identically).

          Following is a sample QMHOST.PWD file:

          John Friel       Password  1  1-319-233-6157   ; Moi
          Joe Blow         Qmodem    0                   ; another example

          Records may be in any order (the SYSOP record need not be first).
          In the example above, the first and last entries have a CALLBACK
          number and will work in a CALLBACK system, while the second entry




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   154
          =================================================================



          will not.

          Security Levels may be "1" or "0". Level 1 users may shut down
          the system from remote (as long as they know the password). Other
          security levels are unassigned and are reserved for future use.
          Files created by the Host

          Two files are created by the Host the first time it is invoked:

             QMHOST.HDR    The Message Header file.

             QMHOST.MSG    The Message Text File.

          These two files may not be edited or modified in any way. If they
          are, unpredictable results will occur while messaging. The
          message base can be packed (killed messages are deleted) by
          running the QMHOSTPK.EXE program supplied on the Utilities disk.
          (Refer to the Message Section for more information on
          QMHOSTPK.EXE)

          Optional Files Host Menu files can be customized to meet your
          needs. The following default menu files are supplied:

             PRELOG.HST    The opening screen sent to all callers

             MENU.HST      The Host Main Menu

             PROTS.HST     The protocol list for Up/Download commands

             LOGOFF.HST    The logoff screen sent to all callers

          Menu Files are all standard ASCII files and can be edited with
          the Internal Editor.

          Host Mode supports ANSI color/graphic menus, but these cannot be
          selectively disabled. If you use ANSI menus, all callers must
          have ANSI emulation active to correctly view the screens.

          Included on the Utilities Disk, are sample menu files for you to
          experiment with. These files all end with the extension .HST .

          Logging on Locally

          While Host Mode is active, you may press [F1] to log on locally.
          This feature can be used to test menu and Script operation. All
          Host commands, except Page the Sysop are available locally.
          Attempting to do an Upload or Download will allow you to verify
          that the protocols are installed correctly, but no transfers will
          actually take place.

          =================================================================



          When you are finished, you should use the G command to log off.

          To exit Host Mode, press [ESC] while the system is waiting for a
          call. You will be returned to TERMINAL mode and the Modem
          Initialization string (Alt-N/M/M/I) will be sent to the modem.

          Starting the Host while ONLINE

          The HOST can be invoked while you are on-line. The other person
          you are connected to will be prompted for logon information as if
          the host had answered the incoming call itself.

          If the caller is unsuccessful in his logon, the host will drop
          the connection and cycle. There is no method to return to normal
          terminal without dropping the connection once the host is
          started.

          Sysop Commands while the Host is active 

          When a caller is on-line, the SYSOP may break into chat mode by
          pressing [F2], Dropping to DOS locally by pressing [F5] or
          disconnect the caller by pressing [F10]. At all times, Host Mode
          will accept input from the remote caller as well as from the
          local keyboard. The SYSOP, for example, may come to the rescue of
          a caller by typing commands directly. These will be processed as
          if they had been typed by the remote caller.

          Uploads and Downloads may be canceled by pressing [ESC] key. It
          is not considered nice to cancel a download on the 244th block of
          a 245-block file.

          F2     Chatting with the Caller

          Pressing [F2] initiates an on-line chat between the caller and
          the sysop:

          (60 min. left) Qmodem Host Command >

          You are now Chatting with the Sysop

          (a conversation may go here...

          Returning you to Host Mode

          Both caller and Sysop may type at will; the display will be
          identical on both computers. End-of-Line wordwrap is also active
          in CHAT mode.

          To exit CHAT mode, the SYSOP must press [F2] again. The message

          =================================================================



          "Returning you to Host Mode" will be displayed and the caller
          will be returned to the Main Menu.

          F5     Dropping to DOS 

          When you drop to DOS, the caller will see the following message:

          Sysop has dropped to DOS. Please wait...

          You then get the DOS prompt just as if you had pressed Alt-R from
          Terminal Mode. When you type [EXIT] and return to the Host, the
          caller will see:

          Ok, you can continue...

          and the main menu will be displayed.

          F10    Disconnecting the Caller

          This is a drastic measure, but one you should know how to use. If
          your system is suddenly beseiged by a gang of Adolescent Deformed
          Kung-fu Crickets with modems, you will want to be sure they get
          the message... Pressing [F10] gives them:

          NO CARRIER

          That's right, nothing. The modem is hung up without a message.

          Now let's look at each command in the Host:

          R      READ MESSAGES

          The "R" Read command is used to read messages. Unlike
          sophisticated On-line Services or Bulletin Board Systems, the
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Host mode does not keep track of each
          caller's "Last Message Read". It is up to callers to remember the
          number of the last message he/she read.

          If the caller presses [ENTER] at the "Start with Msg" prompt, the
          READ command is canceled and the Main Menu is displayed.

          If the number entered is lower than the number of the first
          available message, reading will start with the first available
          message. Likewise, if the number entered is higher than the
          highest message number, the last valid message will be read.

          Following is a sample message-reading session:

               Msg# : 1
                 To : JOHN FRIEL (private) (not read)
               From : JOE BLOW
            Subject : Testing the Host
          Date/Time : 08-14-1990 21:32:03 

          This is just a test, John

          Hope you get it ok!

          Joe

          (R)eply, (K)ill, (Q)uit, [ENTER] next msg >

          Message headers contain Message Number, To, From, Subject, and
          Date & Time information. Message marked (private) or (killed) can
          only be viewed by callers with SYSOP Security or the caller that
          left the message.

          After reading a message, the caller is prompted for one of the
          following actions:

          1. (R)eply to the message just read.

          2. (K)ill the message. A message can be killed if it was
          addressed to the caller or the caller has SYSOP privileges.

          3. (Q)uit and return to the Main Menu.

          4. [ENTER] to read the next message.

          E      ENTER A MESSAGE 

          The "E" command is used to enter a new message. The caller will
          be prompted for the name of the recipient, an appropriate subject
          for the message, and the security status of the message (private
          or public). The actual message is then entered. Messages may have
          up to 20 lines of 72 characters each. As text reaches the end of
          the line, it automatically wraps to the next line.

          Following is a sample message entry session:

          To: The Sysop
          Subject: Testing the Message Base
          Private (y/n) ? N

          Enter your message. 72 chars per line, 16 lines max. Autowrap
          Blank line ends message.
          -------------------------------------------------------------
          This is a test of the emergency broadcasting system...

          This is ONLY a test!

          Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!

          (C)ontinue, (S)ave or (A)bort >

          At the end of the message, the caller presses [ENTER] twice to
          terminate message entry. The Host will then display the
          "(C)ontinue, (S)ave or (A)bort >" prompt.

          C) Continue with message entry - The last line with text is
          displayed with the cursor following the last non-blank character.
          Use this option if you exited the message and wish to add to it.

          S) Save the Message. 

          The message is saved and the user is returned to the Main Menu.
          If the message was entered as a reply, the next message, if any,
          will be displayed.

          A) Abort the Message. 

          The message is deleted and the user is returned to the Main Menu.
          If the message was entered as a reply, then the next message, if
          any, will be displayed.

          The end-of-message prompt will also be issued automatically when
          the messages reaches the 20-line maximum.

          P         PAGE THE SYSOP

          When someone Pages the Sysop, you and the caller will hear one
          beep approximately every second, and see the following:

          Paging Sysop. Press any key to abort...




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   160
          =================================================================



          As the beeps go off, another dot is added to the line. After 20
          or so seconds, the caller is told that you are not answering the
          Page and gives him the Menu again. While he is paging you, the
          Status line tells you that pressing [F2] will answer the Page.
          Then, it is identical to the Chat mode described earlier.

          F         FILES DIRECTORY

          The "F" command lists the contents of the Host Download
          Directory:

          (55 min. left) Qmodem Host Command > F

          --- FILE LIST ---
          OVERLOK.ZIP       4856  13:03  04-27-90
          TESTFILE             0  20:35  08-14-90
          ------ END ------

          Press any key to continue


          If the directory exceeds one page, the caller is prompted to
          continue between them. These are the only files that can be
          downloaded from the Host.

          Exception to Rule :

          IF the caller has Sysop privileges, AND the Alt-N/H/D Download
          Directory is left BLANK, the caller can then Download ANY file
          from the Host system provided he/she knows the EXACT
          drive:\path\filename. The Files command does not prompt for the
          directory to display. It will always show the CURRENT directory
          under these conditions.

          It is assumed that in this case, the caller has his/her Host set
          up securely.

          D         DOWNLOAD FILES 

          When D is selected, the alternate Protocol directory file
          PROTS.HST is searched for and displayed. If this file is not
          found, then the default list of protocols is displayed. Download
          procedures are the same as uploads. Prior to a download, the Host
          verifies the existence of the file to be sent. If the file does
          not exist, the Download is canceled.

          The Host fully supports the Batch transfer protocols. If a batch
          protocol is selected, the user is prompted for up to 20 filenames
          to be downloaded. Each filename can also contain the wildcard




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   161
          =================================================================



          characters * and ?. This allows for even greater flexibility!

          U         UPLOAD FILES

          When the Upload command is selected, the Host first looks for the
          alternate protocol menu file PROTS.HST. If it is found, it is
          displayed. If not, the list of default protocols is displayed.
          The caller can then select the desired protocol. A filename
          prompt will be displayed next for the file transfer. During the
          transfer, the standard QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Download window will
          be displayed.

          The meanings of Uploads and Downloads are reversed while in Host
          Mode -- an Upload by the caller is a Download to the Host, and
          vice-versa --.

          O         OPEN A SCRIPT

          The Open Script command allows QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE script
          execution while in Host Mode; it is the Host equivalent of the
          Alt-F command. When the "O" command is selected, the QMHOST.SCR
          script is executed.

          When logging on locally with the [F1] command, the "O" command
          invokes the QMHOSTL.SCR script rather than the QMHOST.SCR script.
          This allows you to test the script offline. Since QMHOSTL.SCR
          script is executed while offline, it should not test for an
          on-line condition.

          If the Host script is found, it begins executing immediately. If
          the Script is not found, the following message is displayed:

          Sorry, that function is not available.

          Following is a sample QMHOST.SCR:

          FirstNamePrompt: DISPLAY "Enter your First Name > " ; ask for a
          first name

          GETR 0 20                     ; put it in $0

          IF $Offline Exit1             ; if we are offline, then exit 
          IF "$0" <> "" LastNamePrompt  ; If so, go to the next prompt.

          DISPLAYLN "Hey, I want your Last name! Try again...^M^J" 
          GOTO FirstNamePrompt

          LastNamePrompt: DISPLAY "Enter your Last name  > "  ; ask for a
          last name




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   162
          =================================================================



          GETR 1 20                  ; put it in $1

          IF $Offline Exit1          ; are we offline? if so, exit
          IF "$1" <> "" NextStep     ; if a name was entered, go to next
          label

          DISPLAYLN "Hey, I want your Last name! Try again...^M^J"
          GOTO LastNamePrompt

          NextStep:                  ; continue here
          DISPLAYLN " "
          DISPLAYLN "Thank you, $0"
          DISPLAYLN "You will now be returned to the Host...
          DISPLAYLN " "
          DISPLAYLN "Please wait $0 $1"

          Exit1:
          EXIT                       ; exit back to the Host

          The QMHOSTL.SCR version of the script would be modified so that
          the GETR commands would be changed to GET, and the $OFFLINE tests
          would be removed completely.

          The callers First and Last name is passed to the script variables
          $0 and $1 respectively. For more information on QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE Scripts, refer to the Script Language section later in this
          manual.

          S         SHELL TO DOS

          The "S" Shell to DOS command allows access to the DOS prompt
          while Host Mode is active. This command is the Host equivalent of
          the Alt-R command, and similar rules and restrictions apply.
          There is, however, one major difference between the local DOS
          Shell available with the Alt-R command, and the Host Shell. In
          the case of a remote logon, DOS must receive its input from the
          serial port, rather than from the keyboard. If there is a user
          on-line, the Host Shell command executes the QMHOST.BAT batch
          file. If you are logging on as the local Sysop, the Shell command
          operates in the same manner as the Alt-R command.

          The Host passes 4 parameters to the QMHOST.BAT file as follows:

             %1  The current COM port number
             %2  The current Baud rate
             %3  The current Port Base Address (in HEX)
             %4  The IRQ for the current port (in HEX)

          Refer to the README file located on Disk 1 for further

          =================================================================



          instructions on the QMHOST.BAT file.

          The default QMHOST.BAT file can be set up use the DOS CTTY
          function to do the remote Drop to DOS functions. This is not as
          clean a solution as running Doorway, but it does work in a pinch.
          The file would then contains the following lines:

             ECHO OFF
             CTTY COM%1:
             COMMAND
             CTTY CON:

          There is one limitation to the CTTY method you should be made
          aware of. DOS CTTY only supports COM1 and COM2. If you need to
          use COM3 - COM8, you need to look at the DOORWAY program
          described on page 163.

          G         GOODBYE (HANG-UP)

          The Goodbye command allows a clean exit from the Host mode. The
          modem is put back on-hook and returns to "Waiting for call...".

          ?         HELP WITH HOST 

          The ? command will cause the Host to search for the file called
          HELP.HST and display it if found. This is a generic Help file
          that should tell the caller what all the commands are and briefly
          what they do. It should also mention that more help is available
          by typing in a ? followed by the command in question. This will
          display a file by the name of HELP[character].HST where
          [character] is the command letter they want more help with.

          These help files are ASCII text and can be edited by you to
          customize your Host. A default set of help files is included on
          the Utilities Disk.

          HELP.HST  Generic 

          Help about the Host and should include a brief command summary.

          HELPD.HST Download command.

          You should edit to include specific instructions on external
          protocols if any are installed.

          HELPE.HST Enter Message command. 

          Instructions on entering a message.

          =================================================================



          HELPF.HST File List command.

          Tells the caller about your downloadable files.

          HELPG.HST Goodbye command.

          Need I say more?

          HELPO.HST Open Script command.

          This should describe any script systems you install.

          HELPP.HST Page Sysop command.

          You might want to tell them the hours you are around for being
          paged. If you are never around, you might want to tell them to
          always leave a message.

          HELPR.HST Read Message command.

          Instructions on reading messages.

          HELPS.HST Shell to DOS command.

          Most likely, you will not be allowing your callers to do this. On
          the outside chance someone will, this is the help for them.

          HELPU.HST Upload command.

          You might want to tell them about the protocols you have
          installed. Similar to the Download help file.

          HELPZ.HST Shutdown Host command.

          Again, your users should not be doing this, but you never know!

          Z         SHUT DOWN HOST

          The Shutdown command can only be entered by users that have a
          security level of 1. In addition, they must also know the
          shutdown password (Alt-N/H/S). When the correct password is
          entered, the Host hangs up and returns to Terminal mode in QMODEM
          4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          The "Z" does not appear in the default menu for security reasons.
          Out of sight, out of mind.

          Packing the Message Base There is a program called QMHOSTPK.EXE
          included on the Utilities Disk that will pack the Message base.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   165
          =================================================================



          The term PACK refers to removing 'killed' messages.

          You execute QMHOSTPK from the DOS prompt. It assumes the message
          base files QMHOST.MSG and QMHOST.HDR are in the current
          directory.

          Should the message base become corrupted, the files QMHOST.HDR
          and QMHOST.MSG files should be deleted and let the host re-create
          them.

      Alt-MINUS  Status Line Toggle

          The Alt-Minus command toggles ON and OFF the Status Line at the
          bottom of the screen. This is for normal Terminal mode only. When
          running the Host Mode, a Script, or most other Alt commands, the
          appropriate status line(s) will be displayed.

          When turned OFF, it does give you one additional line for use in
          some terminal emulations, and especially useful when using the
          Doorway mode (Alt-Equal).

      Alt-EQUAL  DOORWAY Mode

          Doorway mode allows you to send the entire PC Keyboard Scan Codes
          across the line to the remote system. The exception to this is
          the Alt-Equal key, which is the toggle to get you in and out of
          Doorway mode.

          This is most often used with fullscreen message editors on
          Bulletin Board systems, to allow use of the arrow, page up and
          page down keys.

      Alt-ENTER  Alternate Status Line Toggle

          A little feature that a lot of you requested. The status line can
          now be toggled between the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE standard with
          all the toggles and system information, to one that shows you the
          Name and Number of the last dialed system. Yes, it will show you
          who you are connected to!

          The only restriction is that the number must have been dialed
          from the dialing directory, Alt-D.

          Alt-N/O/R/I Int16 Enable must be set ON for this to function and
          your BIOS and keyboard must support a 101-key system. Old PC's
          and some old XT's may not allow this to work.

      THE INTERNAL EDITOR

          The Internal Editor is a RAM-based editor and similar to the
          Turbo Pascal & SideKick editors. If you are familiar with either
          of these, you should need little help in using the Internal
          Editor (perhaps no more than a look at the Quick Command
          Reference); novices should read on.

      Entering and Editing Text 

          You enter text into the Internal Editor the same way you would on
          a regular typewriter. Most keys behave in the same manner;
          pressing ENTER terminates a text line, for example. But there are
          some important differences too.

          The cursor always indicates where new text will be entered, and
          you can move the cursor in a number of ways. You can correct
          mistakes easily using the Delete commands. You can copy or move
          blocks of text with the Block commands. You can quickly search
          the file for a particular text string with the Find commands.
          And, most of the time, you can "undo" a change with the Line
          Restore command.

          Each command (and there are many more) is described briefly in
          the following section.

      QUICK REFERENCE

          Function                      Keystroke(s)

          Word right                    Ctrl-F or Ctrl-right arrow
          Line up                       Ctrl-E or Up arrow
          Line down                     Ctrl-X or Down arrow

          Exit editor                   Ctrl-KD or F10 or Esc

          When the notation Ctrl- precedes another key, it means that you
          hold down the Ctrl key and press the second key. In the case of
          commands that have a second letter (for example Ctrl-QP), you
          hold down the Ctrl only while pressing the first letter, not the
          second.

      The Editing Screen

          The top line in the Edit Window is called the Edit Status Line
          and should not be confused with the global Status Line at the
          bottom of the screen. The Edit Status Line is inside the window
          and the global is not.

      Basic Movement Commands

          The basic movement commands are those that move the cursor
          without altering the text. The cursor can be moved in one of two
          ways; with a key on the numeric keypad or with a control
          character. For example, to move the cursor to the right once
          character, you can press either the Right Arrow or Ctrl-D.

          In the following listings, the key sequence on the left is the
          primary key sequence and the one on the right, if any, is the
          secondary key sequence. Either can be modified by running the
          EDINSTAL program included on the Utilities Disk.

          The online help for the Internal Editor will not reflect any
          changes you make to the key sequences. Only the default
          installation is shown.

      Character left       Ctrl-S or Left arrow

          Moves the cursor one character to the left. This command does not
          work across line breaks; when the cursor reaches column 1; it
          stops.

      Character right      Ctrl-D or Right Arrow

          Moves the cursor one character to the right. This command does
          not work across line breaks; when the cursor reaches the
          right-hand edge of the text window, the text starts scrolling
          horizontally until it reaches the extreme right edge of the line
          (column 248), where it stops.

      Word left            Ctrl-A or Ctrl-Left arrow

          Moves the cursor to the beginning of the word to the left. This
          command works across line breaks.

      Word right           Ctrl-F or Ctrl-Right arrow

          Moves the cursor to the beginning of the word to the right. This
          command works across line breaks.

          =================================================================



      Line up              Ctrl-E or Up arrow

          Moves the cursor to the line above. If the cursor is on the top
          line of the window, the window scrolls down one line.

      Line down            Ctrl-X or Down arrow

          Moves the cursor to the line below. If the cursor is on the
          next-to-last line of the window, the window scrolls up one line.

      Scroll up            Ctrl-W

          Scrolls up toward the beginning of the file, one line at a time.
          The cursor remains on its line until it reaches the bottom of the
          window.

      Scroll down          Ctrl-Z

          Scrolls down towards the end of the file, one line at a time. The
          cursor remains on its line until it reaches the top of the
          window.

      Page up              Ctrl-R or PgUp

          Moves the cursor one page up with an overlap of one line.

      Page down            Ctrl-C or PgDn

          Moves the cursor one page down with an overlap of one line.

      Beginning of file    Ctrl-QR or Ctrl-PgUp

          Moves the cursor to the first character in the file.

      End of file          Ctrl-QC or Ctrl-PgDn

          Moves the cursor to the last character in the file.

      Beginning of line    Ctrl-QS or Home

          Moves the cursor to column 1 on the current line.

      End of line          Ctrl-QD or End

          Moves the cursor to the end of the current line (the position
          following the last non-blank character on the line). Trailing
          blanks are always removed from all lines to preserve space.

      Top of screen    Ctrl-QE or Ctrl-Home

          Moves the cursor to the top line of the text window.

      Bottom of screen Ctrl-QX or Ctrl-End

          Moves the cursor to the bottom line of the text window.

      Top of block         Ctrl-QB

          Moves the cursor to the position of the block-begin marker set
          with Ctrl-KB. This command works even if the block is hidden with
          the Ctrl-KH command or the block-end marker is not set.

      Bottom of block      Ctrl-QK

          Moves the cursor to the position of the block-end marker set with
          the Ctrl-QK command. The command works even if the block is
          hidden or the block-begin marker is not set.

      Previous cursor position Ctrl-QP

          Moves the cursor to the last position. This command is useful to
          move back to the previous position after a Save, a Find, or a
          Find-and-replace operation. (or in case you hit the wrong
          direction key!)

      Jump to marker 0..3  Ctrl-Q0..Ctrl-Q3

          Moves the cursor to one of the four invisible text markers
          created with the Set marker command. Ctrl-Q0 jumps to marker 0,
          Ctrl-Q1 jumps to marker 1, and so on. If the specified marker has
          not been set, the cursor is not moved.

      Set marker 0..3      Ctrl-K0..Ctrl-K3

          Sets one of the four invisible text markers at the current cursor
          position. Ctrl-K0 sets marker 0, Ctrl-K1 sets marker 1, and so
          on.

      Insert and Delete Commands

          These commands let you insert and delete characters, words, and
          lines. Two related commands are covered in later sections:
          Restore line (Ctrl-QL) and Delete block (Ctrl-KY).

      New line             Ctrl-M or Enter

          In insert mode, this command inserts a line break at the cursor's




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   172

          current position. If Autoindent mode is in effect, the cursor
          moves to the next line and to the same column as the first
          non-blank character in the previous line; otherwise, it moves to
          column 1 of the new line.

          In overwrite mode, this command moves the cursor to column 1 of
          the next line without inserting a new line, whether Autoindent
          mode is in effect or not.

      Insert line          Ctrl-N

          Inserts a line break at the cursor's position. The cursor does
          not move.

      Insert control character Ctrl-P

          Allows control characters to be entered into the text. For
          example, pressing Ctrl-P and then Ctrl-C would insert a Ctrl-C
          (^C) into the text. Control characters are displayed as capital
          letters in the same color as the Status Line.

      Tab              Ctrl-I or Tab

          Moves the cursor to the next tab stop. In Insert mode, any text
          to the right of the cursor is moved along with it; in Overtype
          mode, only the cursor is moved. The location of the next tab stop
          depends on whether fixed tabs or smart tabs are in effect.

      Delete current character    Ctrl-G or Del

          Deletes the character over the cursor and moves any characters to
          the right of the cursor one position to the left. This command
          does not work across line breaks.

      Delete character left   Ctrl-H or Backspace

          Moves the cursor one character to the left and deletes the
          character positioned there. Any characters to the right of the
          cursor are moved one position to the left. If the cursor is in
          column 1 at the time the command is given, the invisible
          end-of-line marker for the previous line is deleted instead, and
          the two lines are joined.

      Delete word             Ctrl-T

          Deletes the word to the right of the cursor. This command works
          across line breaks and thus may be used to remove line breaks.

          =================================================================



      Delete to end of line   Ctrl-QY

          Deletes all text from the position of the cursor to the end of
          the line.

      Delete line             Ctrl-Y

          Deletes the line containing the cursor and moves any lines below
          it up one line. The cursor moves to column 1 of the next line.
          You cannot restore a deleted line, so use this with caution.

      Block Commands

          A block is any arbitrarily defined, contiguous unit of text; a
          block can be as small as a single character or as large as the
          entire file. Mark a block by placing a begin-block marker at the
          first character in the desired block and an end-block marker just
          beyond the last character. Once marked, the block can be copied,
          moved, deleted, or written to a file.

          Although marked blocks are normally highlighted, the block may be
          "hidden" (or made invisible) with the Hide block command. Many of
          the block-manipulation commands described here work only when the
          block is being displayed. The block- related cursor movement
          commands (Ctrl-QB and Ctrl-QK, described in the "Basic Movement
          Commands") work whether the block is hidden or displayed.

      Begin block             Ctrl-KB or F7

          Marks the beginning of a block. The marker itself is not visible
          on the screen, and the block becomes visible only when the
          end-block marker is set. You can also use the begin-block marker
          as an extra text marker and jump directly to it with Ctrl-QB.

      End block               Ctrl-KK or F8

          Marks the end of a block. Like the begin-block marker, the
          end-block marker is invisible, and the block itself will not be
          displayed unless both markers are set. You can also use the
          end-block marker as an extra text marker and jump directly to it
          with Ctrl-QK.

      Copy block              Ctrl-KC

          Creates a copy of a marked and displayed block at the current
          cursor position. The original block is left unchanged, and the
          markers are placed around the new copy of the block.

          =================================================================



      Move block              Ctrl-KV

          Moves a marked and displayed block from its current position to
          the cursor's position. The markers remain around the block at its
          new position.

      Delete block            Ctrl-KY

          Deletes a marked and displayed block. There is no command to
          restore a deleted block, so use caution with this command.

      Hide block              Ctrl-KH

          Toggles on and off the visual marking of a block. Block
          manipulation commands work only when the block is being
          displayed.

      Mark single word     Ctrl-KT

          Marks a single word as a block, combining the functions of the
          Begin-block and End-block commands. If the cursor is positioned
          within a word, that word will be marked. If it is not within a
          word, then the word to the left of the cursor will be marked. And
          if there is no word to the right of the cursor, then the word to
          the left will be marked.

      Read block from file    Ctrl-KR

          Reads a file into the text at the cursor's current position
          exactly as if it were copied from another part of the text. The
          file read in is marked as a block. When you use this command, you
          are prompted for the name of the file to read. If you have used
          this command earlier in the editing session, the last file name
          entered will be displayed. You may enter a new file name, make
          minor changes to the one displayed using the Backspace key, or
          accept it by pressing ENTER. The file specified may be any legal
          file name, including a drive and/or path identifier. Cancel the
          command by pressing Ctrl-U.

      Write block to file     Ctrl-KW

          Writes the currently marked block to a file. The block is left
          unchanged, and the block markers remain in place. You are first
          prompted for a filename. The file specified can be any legal file
          name, including a drive and/or path identifier. You should avoid
          using file names with the extension .BAK, because this extension
          is used by the Internal Editor when creating backup files. If the
          file specified already exists, you are asked if you want to
          overwrite it. If you press "N" (for NO), you can enter a new file




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   175
          =================================================================



          name, make minor changes, or cancel the command with the Ctrl-U
          command. If no block is marked, this command is ignored.

      Print                   Ctrl-KP

          Prints the currently marked and displayed block on the default
          printer. If no block is marked or the block is hidden, the entire
          file is printed.

      Miscellaneous Commands

          This section describes a number of commands that do not fall into
          any previous category.

      Toggle insert mode      Ctrl-V or Ins

          Selects Insert or Overwrite mode. In Insert mode, text to the
          right of the cursor is moved to the right as new text is entered.
          In Overwrite mode, any text to the right of the cursor is
          overwritten when new text is entered.

      Toggle autoindent       Ctrl-QI

          When Autoindent mode is in effect, the New line command (Enter or
          Ctrl-M) will move the cursor to the next row and to the same
          column as the first non- blank character on the previous line.

      Toggle fixed tabs       Ctrl-OT

          When fixed tabs are in effect, the tab stops (normally) start at
          column 9 and occur every 8 columns thereafter. By default, fixed
          tabs are off, and smart tabs are on. When smart tabs are in use,
          the tab stops are determined by the locations of the words on the
          previous line; the first character in each word represents a tab
          stop. When fixed tabs are used, the Tab command inserts a single
          tab character at the cursor's position. When smart tabs are used,
          the tab is stored as a series of blanks.

      Restore line            Ctrl-QL

          Undoes any changes made to a line of text as long as you have not
          left the line. The line is restored to its previous contents
          regardless of the changes made. Since the Delete line command
          (Ctrl-Y) moves the cursor to what was previously another line,
          Restore line cannot recover lines deleted with it.

      Find                    Ctrl-QF

          Lets you search for a string of up to 30 characters. When you




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   176
          =================================================================



          enter this command, the status line is cleared and you will be
          asked for a search string. The last search string entered (if
          any) will be displayed. You can select it again by pressing
          Enter, edit it, or enter a new string. When editing strings,
          Backspace deletes the previous character, Ctrl-R restores the
          previous string, Ctrl-S moves the cursor to the left, and Ctrl-D
          shows the next character to the right. Esc or Ctrl-U will cancel
          a search command, and Ctrl-P can be used to enter control
          characters.

          After the search string is entered, you must specify your search
          options. The options you used last, if any, are displayed.
          Editing works the same as the search string edit. The following
          options are available:

          B  Searches backwards from the current cursor position toward
             the beginning of the file.

          L  Limits searches to the currently marked block.

          n  n may be any number. Find the nth occurrence of the search
             string, counted from the current cursor position.

          U  Ignore case; treats all alphabetic characters as if they were
             uppercase.

          W  Searches for whole words only; skips matching patterns
             embedded in other words.

          If the text contains a target matching the search string, the
          cursor is positioned at the end of the target.

      Find and replace     Ctrl-QA

          This operation works the same as the Find command, except that
          you can replace the "found" string with any other string of up to
          30 characters. After entering the search string, you are asked to
          enter the replacement string. The last replacement string, if
          any, will be displayed; you can accept it, edit it, or enter a
          new string.

          Finally, you are prompted for options. The options you used last
          are displayed at first. You can enter new options (canceling the
          old ones), edit the current options, or select the same options
          by pressing Enter. The options are the same as those for the Find
          command with the following exceptions:

          G  Searches globally. The entire file is scanned for the search
             string, regardless of the current position of the cursor. The




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   177
          =================================================================



             search starts at the beginning of the file if searching
             forward; at the end if searching backwards.

          N  Replaces without asking. Does not prompt for confirmation at
             each occurrence of the search string.

          If the text contains a target matching the search string, the
          cursor is positioned at the end of the target. You are then asked
          if you wish to replace it. Press "Y" to replace it, or "N" to
          ignore it. You can abort the operation by pressing Ctrl-U. If you
          selected the N (no prompting) option, this question will not be
          asked.

          You can speed up global search-and-replace operations by
          selecting the N option and then pressing a key (preferably for a
          nonprinting character, such as ESC or Ins). The screen is then no
          longer updated when each replacement is made.

      Find next               Ctrl-L

          Repeats the last search operation. If the last search command
          called for a Find operation, the same search string and options
          will be repeated; for a Find-and-replace operation, the
          replacement string will be reused as well.

      Exit Editor             Ctrl-KD

          Saves the file being edited and exits from the editor. The
          original file, if any, is renamed to FILENAME.BAK.

      EDINSTAL - Keyboard Installation Program

          You can use the EDINSTAL program (on the Utilities Disk) to
          customize the Internal Editor. You can redefine the keystrokes
          (both primary and secondary) used to invoke the predefined
          commands. For example, the Toggle fixed tabs command is by
          default assigned to Ctrl-OT using EDINSTAL, you could assign this
          command to Shift-Tab.

          Running EDINSTAL

          Load EDINSTAL by typing EDINSTAL at the DOS command line. The
          QMODEM.EXE file must be in the current directory for this to run.
          If it is, you will be asked

             Perform fast entry for fully reconfigured keyboard?

          If you press "Y" for yes, you can install the keyboard using the
          fast-entry method. The default response, No, can be given by




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   178
          =================================================================



          pressing "N" or Enter. If you answer No, the keyboard will be
          installed using the random access method.

          Fast Entry 

          When you select the fast-entry option, you will see the following
          instructions:

   Press <Enter> to accept default
   Press keys followed by <Enter> for new key sequence
   Press <Bksp> to back up one keystroke, C to clear, R to restore
   Press <Scroll Lock> to toggle literal mode
   Press <Escape> to quit entering commands
   Random access editing is available when you are finished

          You can then either enter a new key sequence for each command or
          accept the current one by pressing Enter. Both the command name
          and the current key sequence are always displayed to the left of
          the cursor. You specify a new key sequence by pressing the keys
          you wish to use to invoke that command. Pressing Enter terminates
          your entry.

          You can correct mistakes in the current entry by pressing the
          Backspace key (delete last keystroke), C (Clear entry), or R
          (Restore previous entry). To specify either the Enter key or a
          Ctrl-M, you must first press the Scroll Lock key, which indicates
          that keystrokes are to be interpreted literally; press it again
          when you've finished entering the key sequence. Pressing Esc
          stops the fast-entry procedure and takes you to the random access
          entry screen.

          Random Access

          When you select the random access option or when you have
          finished using the fast-entry procedure, you can alter any or all
          of the default key sequences. The top line of the screen will
          give you some basic instructions. The remainder of the screen
          shows (from left to right) the name of the command, the primary
          key sequence, and the secondary key sequence (if any).

          Move the cursor to the key sequence you want to change and press
          Enter. Use the Left arrow and Right arrow keys to select the
          primary or secondary key sequences, and scroll through the list
          of commands using the Up arrow, Down arrow, PgUp, and PgDn keys.
          Home takes you to the first command, and End to the last.

          You can correct mistakes the same way as the fast-entry edit.

          =================================================================



          Quitting the Program

          When you have finished making changes, press "Q" to quit or "W"
          to write your changes to the QMODEM.EXE file. If you choose the
          Write option, you will then see the message "Checking for
          conflicts..." If you have accidentally assigned the same key
          sequence to two different commands, an error message will be
          displayed. You can correct your mistakes by searching for the
          highlighted items.

          You will also see an error message if the new list of keystrokes
          is too large for the area set aside for it. You can easily solve
          this problem by eliminating a few secondary key sequences.

          THE QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE SCRIPT LANGUAGE

          What is a script? A script is a QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE program,
          designed to perform specific and/or repetitive functions much
          faster and more reliably than with manual methods. Scripts can be
          used to do just about anything that can be done at the keyboard;
          your imagination is the only limit. Common uses for scripts
          include:

          1. Automated logon
          2. File transfers
          3. Completely automated sessions
          4. Unattended QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operations

          The QuickLearn Script Recorder is an extremely convenient
          facility, but it has its limitations. Basically, QuickLearn can
          only record your interactions with a remote computer and
          replicate them exactly. It cannot add decision-making logic to
          the scripts it creates, or account for unexpected or changing
          conditions. When you run out of QuickLearn power, time has come
          to write or edit your own scripts.

          Scripts are similar to interpreted BASIC programs. The syntax is
          somewhat different, but the principles are almost identical. The
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Script Interpreter (also referred to as the
          Script Parser) reads the script's code and executes the
          instructions as it reads them.

          Scripts can be very simple or extremely involved. Logon scripts
          created by QuickLearn are simple. Some large and complex scripts
          have also been written to turn QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE into a
          mini-Bulletin Board System. With the advent of BBS Networks such
          as InterLink, scripts have been written to automatically dial a
          BBS, log on, open a mail transfer door, download a mail packet,
          and log off. Many useful QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE scripts are
          included on the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Utilities disk. Many other
          scripts can be found on bulletin boards, including Mustang
          Software HQ!, Home of QMODEM.

          You need not be a programmer to write scripts, but if you aren't,
          we recommend that you start at the beginning until you have a
          good understanding of script concepts, syntax rules, and common
          script commands.

          As with all programming languages, The QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          script language has a few idiosyncracies. Here are some of the
          most obvious.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   181
          =================================================================



          Physical vs. Logical Screen

          The physical screen is the entire screen, which usually consists
          of 80 columns and 25 lines (or more if you have an EGA or VGA and
          use one of the extended display modes).

          Smaller, logical screens can be defined with the script BOX or
          WINDOW commands. All screen output commands except ATWRITE are
          limited to the logical screen boundaries defined in the last BOX
          or WINDOW commands.

          Input and Output Commands

          The script language has a wealth of input and output commands,
          each with a specific purpose. For example, there are six commands
          available to read input from the keyboard and/or COM port (GET,
          GETN, GETR, GETNR, GETX, and INKEY), and seven commands available
          to display data on the screen and/or send it to the COM port
          (ATWRITE, SEND, DISPLAY, DISPLAYLN, NOTE, WRITE, and WRITELN). In
          addition, the WHEN command can also be used to send data to the
          COM port when specific COM input is received.

          Variable Handling Variables used in scripts do not have
          explicitly declared types such as INTEGER or STRING. The string
          "100", for example, could be used as a numeric variable as well
          as a text variable. It is your responsibility to insure that the
          variable contents are numeric when they need to be.

          When a variable name is prefixed with a dollar sign, the Script
          Interpreter will automatically substitute its value in the
          command. When a value is assigned to a string, the dollar sign is
          omitted. It is important to understand this concept to put it to
          good use.

          Regardless of their contents, script variables cannot exceed 64
          characters.

          Running Scripts

          Scripts may be invoked explicitly with the Alt-F command. They
          may also be run automatically by specifying a script name on the
          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE command line, or if the script name is
          defined in a directory entry (Linked Scripts), in which case the
          script will start executing when the connection is made.

      Script Commands 

          The QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE script language is very comprehensive.
          Almost all terminal mode manual commands are available as script




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   182
          =================================================================



          commands (and then some). Since equivalent script commands
          perform the same functions as their manual counterpart, we also
          recommend that you familiarize yourself with the manual commands
          first; its documentation more thorough and we did not see the
          need to duplicate it for the script command. Commands that are
          unique to the script environment are covered in detail, however.

          The script language is a programming language, and script files
          are special QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE programs intended to perform
          specific functions. If you are not a programmer, do not let this
          intimidate you. The script language is easy to learn, and scripts
          are easy to read and modify. Error messages are clear and
          concise. The built-in debugger and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Editor
          will help you along as you develop your scripts, in the unlikely
          event you make a mistake.

          Scripts can be very flexible. They can be used in many ways that
          aren't described here. Scripts fall into one of four categories:

          1. Linked scripts, 

          These scripts are physically named in entries in the QMODEM 4.5
          TEST DRIVE Phone Directory. When connection is made, the script
          is executed automatically. The same script can be linked to
          multiple entries. These scripts are often referred to as "Logon
          Scripts", because they take control immediately after a connect
          and usually automate boring and repetitive logon processes.

          Examples:

          1. A BBS system has three nodes with different phone numbers. A
             single script like BOARD.LOG can be linked to all three
             numbers.

          2. Scripts started with the Alt-F command, which require
             execution-time parameters. QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE allows up to
             ten variable parameters to be passed to a script.

          3. Scripts linked to Function Keys. Because they are stored in a
             Function Key Macro, you do not have to re-enter the
             parameters each time you run the Script.

          4. Stand-alone Scripts, requiring no parameters. These scripts
             can be executed automatically when QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is
             started, by specifying their name in a command-line
             parameter.

          =================================================================



          Example:

          To execute the script DOFIRST.SCR when starting QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE, use the command:

             C>QMODEM /S=DOFIRST.SCR<cr>

          Once initialization is complete, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE will load
          and execute the script whose name was specified in the /S=
          command-line parameter. This command line could be contained in a

      How to Create and Name a Script

          Any standard ASCII text editor or word processor can be used to
          create a script file. You may save scripts under any file name
          and extension, but using the ".SCR" file extension makes life
          much easier, as we'll see later.

          The easiest way to write a script is to let QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
          do it for you! Refer to the Alt-Q (QuickLearn) command for
          complete details. But, if you insist on doing it yourself with
          your favorite Word processor or Editor, remember these tips:

          1. Scripts must be saved as standard, CR/LF-delimited ASCII
             files. Non-ASCII files like those produced by Wordstar
             Document mode won't work (for Wordstar, use N at the opening
             prompt to create scripts in the Non-Document mode).

          2. Each Script command must be on a separate line in the file.

          We recommend the Internal Editor for creating and editing
          scripts. Refer to the Alt-V and Alt-J/@EDIT commands for
          information.

      Starting a Script

          There are 3 ways to start a Script:

          1. The command line switch /S= to "auto start" a script. Refer
             to the Command Line Switches for a description.

          2. The explicit Alt-F command to call a script;.

          3. Automatic execution of a Linked-Script attached to a Phone
             Directory entry. (See Alt-D for instructions on attaching a
             script to a dialing directory entry)

      Stopping a Script

          You can stop a script at any time by pressing the [ESC] key. The
          Status line will change to the following:

   °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°° S-Single Step   T-Trace   G-Go   A-Abort °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

          To cancel the script, press "A". Pressing "G" resumes script
          execution at the point where it was interrupted. The "S" and "T"
          commands are used to start Script Debug Mode (more on this
          later).

      Debugging a Script

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE includes a powerful script debugger,
          complete with single-step and trace/animate features. In
          addition, if a script fails, the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Internal
          Editor can be automatically invoked with the cursor positioned at
          the exact point where the error was detected.

          Following is a simple script example to illustrate the debugger's
          operation:

          ; 
          ; Script example
          ;
          DISPLAYLN "this is the value of variable COUNTER : $COUNTER "
          EXIT

          The fourth line in the script refers to a variable called
          $COUNTER. This variable was not defined, and an error will
          result. Executing the script will cause the following window to
          be displayed:

          In both examples, identifying labels were not found in the
          script.

          So far, we have seen the automated debugger at work. An error
          occurs, and you are immediately notified of it. QMODEM 4.5 TEST
          DRIVE also features an Interactive Debugging mode, in which you
          are in control. To start the interactive debugger, the DEBUG ON
          command is used.

          Following is an example of interactive debugging:

          ;
          ; Script example
          ;
          DEBUG ON               ; turn on the debugger

          STRING ONE TWO THREE   ; define 3 new variables
          ASSIGN ONE  "1"        ; give them numeric values
          ASSIGN TWO   "2"
          ASSIGN THREE "3"
          DISPLAYLN " ONE = $ONE, TWO = $TWO, and THREE = $THREE"
          EXIT

          When the script is executed, the status line will change to:

          DEBUG << >>

          In interactive debug mode, the next script line to be executed is
          displayed between the << >> characters. To execute the statement,
          press the Spacebar. In the example, the first line following the
          DEBUG command is blank, and no text appears between the << >>.

          Pressing the Spacebar yields the following series of DEBUG status
          displays:

          DEBUG <<STRING ONE TWO THREE >>

          DEBUG <<ASSIGN ONE   "1" >>

          DEBUG <<ASSIGN TWO   "2" >>

          DEBUG <<ASSIGN THREE "3" >>

          DEBUG <<DISPLAYLN " ONE = $ONE, TWO = $TWO, and THREE = $THREE"
          >>

          A number of useful debug commands are available while
          single-stepping through a script. Pressing the F1 key displays a
          summary of these commands on the status line:

   [SPACE] Next  [T] Trace  [G] Go  [S] Subst. Line  [O] Orig. Line  [U] Under

          After the command summary line has been displayed for
          approximately 2 seconds, the status line reverts back to the
          standard DEBUG display.

          Interactive Debug commands include:

          [SPACE] Next

          Pressing the Spacebar executes the line displayed between the 
          << >> characters.

          [T] Trace

          Pressing "T" starts executing the script at the rate of 2 lines
          per second (Animate Mode).

          [G] Go

          Pressing "G" terminates interactive debug mode and resumes script
          executing with the next line. The script will execute until it
          ends normally, an error occurs, or another DEBUG ON command is
          found.

          [S] Subst. Line

          Pressing "S" displays (substitutes) the values of all variables
          in the current script line prior to execution.

          [O] Orig. Line

          Pressing "O" terminates variable substitution and re-displays
          current line in its Original form.

          [U] Under

          Pressing "U" temporarily suspends display of the Debug status
          line when running the script in full-screen mode and the normal
          status line itself is disabled (Alt-N/V/T/T OFF).

          Going back to our script example, pressing "S" yields the
          following display:

          DEBUG <<DISPLAYLN " ONE = 1, TWO = 2, and THREE = 3" >>

          pressing [Spacebar] again...

          DEBUG <<EXIT >>

          pressing [Spacebar] again...

          Returns us to the normal status line following the end of the
          script.

          Special Characters in Scripts

          In scripts, the caret (^) is used as a modifier when combined
          with certain other characters:

          ^~ A caret-tilde (~) combination generates a 1/2 second delay.

          ^^ A double-caret sequence yields a single-caret character.

          To insert control characters in your scripts, prefix the letter
          with the ^ (caret).

          Following is a list of valid control characters and the
          corresponding caret combinations:

          Dec    Hex   Ctrl   Dec    Hex   Ctrl

           0     00    ^@     16     10    ^P
           1     01    ^A     17     11    ^Q
           2     02    ^B     18     12    ^R
           3     03    ^C     19     13    ^S
           4     04    ^D     20     14    ^T
           5     05    ^E     21     15    ^U
           6     06    ^F     22     16    ^V
           7     07    ^G     23     17    ^W
           8     08    ^H     24     18    ^X
           9     09    ^I     25     19    ^Y
          10     0A    ^J     26     1A    ^Z
          11     0B    ^K     27     1B    ^[
          12     0C    ^L     28     1C    ^\
          13     0D    ^M     29     1D    ^]
          14     0E    ^N     31     1F    ^_
          15     0F    ^O

          Control characters are case-insensitive: ^C is the same as a ^c.




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   189
          =================================================================



          To generate the double-caret ^^ character in the internal editor,
          first type ^P, then type ^^. The editor will display a "^" in the
          same colors as the header line rather then normal text colors.
          This is normal and is used to represent an imbedded Ctrl
          character.

          Comments may be added to scripts, and must be preceded by a
          semi-colon (;):

          ; A semicolon as the first character is always a comment

          WAITFOR "Enter your password :"  ; This is a comment 
          SEND    "$Password^M"            ; another comment line 
          PASSWORD1:                       ; a comment after a label

          Comments are not displayed during script execution.

          Make it a habit to add comments to your scripts wherever and
          whenever possible. Comments are an invaluable help when debugging
          or making changes to scripts, especially older, long-forgotten
          ones.

      Definitions and Parameters

          Script statements usually consist of an operation code and one or
          more operands or parameters. Parameters shown in brackets [] are
          optional. Parameters in quotes (" " or ' ') are mandatory.

          For example:

          DIAL  "1" 
          DIAL 'TMUstang'

          Single- and double-quote characters should not be mixed except in
          special cases. For example, to send the following message:

          John said, "QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is the BEST!"

          you would code the following:

          SEND 'John said, "QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is the BEST!"'

          Single- and double-quote characters are interchangeable, but must
          be used in matched pairs. As shown above, use of one set of quote
          characters allows you to include the other as part of a text
          string. To send the following string:

          John's password is QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   190
          =================================================================



          the script code would be:

          SEND "John's password is QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE"

      Labels

          Labels define the targets of EXIST, GOTO, GOSUB, IF and WHEN
          commands. All labels must end with a colon. Below are some
          examples of valid script labels:

          EXIT_LABEL: 
          A: 
          A_LONG_LABEL: 
          A_much_longer_label_than_the_others:

          Labels must appear on a line by themselves. Comments are the only
          other statements allowed on label lines.

      Pre-defined String Variables

          The variables $0 through $9 are pre-defined and may be used
          anywhere in place of user-defined string variable. In addition,
          variables $0-$9 must be used if data is to be passed to the
          script in the form of parameters in the Alt-F command or F-key
          macros.

          String variables may not exceed 64 characters in length. The
          variables $0-$9 can be set with the ASSIGN, GET, GETR, GETN,
          GETNR and GETX commands. For example, the statement:

          ASSIGN 0 "This is a test"

          store the text string:

          This is a test

          into variable $0.

          Since string variables are replaced with their actual values
          before script commands are executed, the leading $ is omitted
          when one of the pre-defined string variables is the first operand
          in an ASSIGN statement. The following examples further illustrate
          this principle:

          ASSIGN; 0 "QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is the Best!"   ; $0 becomes the
          quoted string ASSIGN 1 $0; $1 is set to $0

          And the statement:




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   191
          =================================================================



          SEND "$1"                  ;the string $1 is sent

          would send the following string to the modem:

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE is the Best!

          Script commands can actually be stored into string Variables with
          an ASSIGN command, and used later in the script. For example:

          ASSIGN 0 "WAITFOR "    ; $0 = WAITFOR[space] 
          $0 "Password "

          would be interpreted as:

          WAITFOR "Password "

          If a dollar sign ($) is required as part of a text string, that
          character must be duplicated. For example:

          SEND "This is a dollar sign : $$"

          will send the following:

          This is a dollar sign : $

          String variables are very powerful tools indeed! With their
          flexible text and command substitution features, what can be done
          with them is only limited by your own imagination.

          The next section of the manual describes QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's
          script commands in detail. Commands are listed in alphabetical
          order, and appropriate coding examples are included for each
          command.

      System Variables

          Most of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE's environment and operating
          parameters are stored in pre-defined, read-only variables which
          are available during script execution.

          Pre-defined variables may not be the target of ASSIGN, GET or
          INKEY commands.

          $DATE     The $DATE variable contains the current system date,
                    based on the internal clock. The date is returned as
                    defined in Alt-N/O/C/D Date Mask.

          $TIME     The $TIME variable is similar to the $DATE variable.
                    The time is returned in the format as defined in the

          =================================================================



                    Alt-N/O/C/T Time Mask.

          $LAST_ROW The $LAST_ROW variable contains the number of the last
                    line on the screen, not including the Status Line. For
                    example, on an 80x25 screen, this variable contains the
                    value 24.

          $LAST_COL The $LAST_COL variable contains the physical screen
                    width, in columns. On a 25x80 screen, this variable
                    contains the value 80.

          $ATTR     The $ATTR variable contains the screen's current Color
                    Attribute. In a script which changes the screen color,
                    this value may be saved at the beginning of the script,
                    and restored before the script terminates to
                    re-establish the normal default screen color.

          $DLPATH   This contains the Download Path as specified in the
                    Alt-N/D/D Setup variable. You could use this to point
                    to the download directory when using the DOWNLOAD
                    script command.

          $ULPATH   This contains the Upload Path as specified in the
                    Alt-N/D/U Setup variable. It could be used in
                    combination with the UPLOAD script command.

          $SCPATH   This is the Script Directory Path as specified by the
                    Alt-N/D/S Setup variable. All temporary scripts should
                    be stored in this directory.

      Connect Information Variables

          QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE stores information relating to the last
          successful connection (or the current one, if ONLINE) in a series
          of variables. For information to be valid, the connection must
          have been established through a standard DIAL command or a linked
          script.

          $BOARD    The $BOARD variable contains the name field of the
                    directory entry to which QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE was last
                    successfully connected. This is a variable-length
                    string which does not exceed 34 characters.

                    If you use the default QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Phone
                    Directory, the commands:

                    DIAL "1"               ;dial the first phone book
                    entry 
                    NOTE Connected to $BOARD!     ;display a connect msg

                    will display:

                    Connected to Mustang Software HQ!!

          $NUMBER   The $NUMBER variable contains the phone number of the
                    last connected entry, as shown in the dialing
                    directory.

                    Using the same example:

                    NOTE Connected to $BOARD at $NUMBER.

                    will display:

                    Connected to Mustang Software HQ! at 1-805-395-0650.

          $PASSWORD The $PASSWORD variable contains the password field for
                    the last connected entry, as stored in the dialing
                    directory. $PASSWORD can be used in a generic logon
                    (linked) script for BBSs running the same software. The
                    following example will operate with WILDCAT! systems:

                    NOTE      Connected to $BOARD ;display after connection

                    WAITFOR   "First name"        ;wait for the name prompt

                    SEND      "FIRST;LAST^M"      ;send your name
                    WAITFOR   "Password"          ;wait for password prompt
                    SEND      "$PASSWORD^M"       ;send the linked password

          $SCRIPT   The $SCRIPT variable contains the name of the linked
                    script for the connected entry, as stored in the
                    dialing directory. Using the above example, we could
                    add another line as follows:

                    NOTE This is script $SCRIPT

                    which would display:

                    This is script MSI.SCR

          $PROTOCOL The $PROTOCOL variable contains the default file
                    transfer protocol assigned to the connected entry. It
                    is used in SEND strings or script DOWNLOAD commands, as
                    illustrated in the following example, which sends a
                    file download request to a WILDCAT! BBS at the
                    start-of-transfer prompt, and starts the actual
                    download:

                    SEND      "D $PROTOCOL FILENAME.ARC^M"  
                    WAITFOR   "[ctrl-X] to abort"
                    DOWNLOAD  $PROTOCOL FILENAME.ARC

          $SPEED    The $SPEED variable contains the current serial rate
                    (i.e.., 300, 1200, 2400, 9600 etc...). The serial baud
                    rate is set by the by the redialer before each number
                    is dialed. If you are connected at 2400, the following
                    command:

                    NOTE   Connected at $SPEED this time

                    will display:

                    Connected at 2400 this time

                    The baud rate may not be reset, depending on the state
                    of the "Lock DTE Baud Rate" toggle in the Alt-N/M/T
                    Setup menu.

          $COM      The $COM variable contains the remainder of the
                    communication parameters, in the form of
                    Databits-Parity-Stopbits. If your current settings are
                    No parity, 8 data bits, and one stop bit, and your
                    serial rate is 2400, the command:

                    NOTE Connected at $SPEED-$COM

                    will display:

                    Connected at 2400-8-N-1

          $NOTEFILE This is the full DOS filename for the Attached Note
                    file. Each entry has a unique Note file that can store
                    information. Using this variable in combination with
                    the text IO Script commands (OPENFILE, READFILE,
                    CLOSEFILE), you can store remote computer specific
                    information and load it every time you call that
                    system.

                    Example Script SHOWNOTE.SCR:

                    EXIST $NOTEFILE CONT          ;see if it exists 
                    DISPLAYLN "No attached notes" ;nope, say so 
                    RETURN                        ;exit back to logon
                    script
                    CONT:
                    DISPLAYLN "Contents of attached Note file:"
                    DISPLAYLN "-------------------------------"

                    OPENFILE $NOTEFILE READ    ;open the note file
                    READLOOP:
                       READFILE 0              ;read
                       IF "$0" = "_EOF_" DONE  ;if end-of-file, jump to
                    DONE
                       DISPLAYLN "$0"          ;display the line
                       GOTO READLOOP           ;go back and read some more
                    DONE:
                    CLOSEFILE                  ;close the note file
                    RETURN                     ;return back to the logon
                    script

                    This script simply opens the attached Note file and
                    displays the contents. To activate it, just use the
                    SCRIPT command to call this as a subroutine:

                    ;
                    ;  QuickLearn Script generated at 02:35:18 on 08-22-88
                    ;  May require editing before use.
                    ;

                    NOTE Attached Note File is : $NOTEFILE  ;if you're
                    curious

      Script Commands

          General Coding Information 

          Script commands usually consist of an Operation Code, often
          referred to as OpCode, and one or more Operands, also referred to
          as arguments, targets, or parameters. Opcode and operands are
          separated with spaces. In certain cases, a relational operator
          may separate parameters. For example, the script IF command has
          two operands separated by a relational operator:

          IF "$0" = "$1" ROUTINE

          IF is the OpCode, "$0", "$1" and ROUTINE are the operands, and =
          is the relational operator. In the example, the command compares
          the contents of variables 0 and 1, and branches to ROUTINE if
          they are equal.

          Operands fall in one of the following categories:

          EXPNUM:   explicit numeric values. As with numeric variables,
                    these values must be integers in the range 0-32,767.
                    For example, in the command:

                    WINDOW 1 1 25 80

                    1 1 25 and 80 are explicit numeric values.

          KEYWORD:  keywords are reserved words defined internally in the
                    script language. For example, all modem system
                    variables and TURNON/TURNOFF parameters are keywords
                    which may not be used as variable names for any other
                    purpose.

          LABEL:    labels identify the beginning of a routine in a script.
                    They are normal words followed by a colon. They are
                    used as parameters in explicit GOTO and GOSUB
                    statements, or implicitly in IF, WAITFOR and WHEN
                    statements:

                    IF "$0" = "$1" ROUTINE .
                    .
                    .
                    ROUTINE:
                    .
                    .

                    if variable 0 is equal to variable 1, branch to the
                    label called ROUTINE.

                    .
                    .

                    branches unconditionally to the label MYPARTY.

          NUMVAR:   numeric variable. All numeric values and variables used
                    in scripts must be positive integers, and their value
                    may not exceed 32,767. Numeric variables are not
                    defined explicitly; the same variable may be used for
                    the storage of text or numeric data. It is the user's
                    responsibility to insure that the variable contains
                    numeric data when required.

          STRING:   a string is an element of text delimited by quotes.
                    Strings may contain imbedded blanks. In the example:

                    ASSIGN 0 "This is text"

                    "This is text" is a string.

          WORD:     a self-delimiting alphanumeric value not bound by
                    quotes, and not containing imbedded blanks. A word can
                    also be defined as a string without blanks and without
                    quotes. In the example:

                    ASSIGN 0 THISISAWORD

                    THISISAWORD is a word variable. The command:

                    ASSIGN 0 "THISISAWORD"

                    is functionally identical to the previous one.

        ASSIGN

        Function       Store a value into a variable.

        Declaration    ASSIGN  VARIABLE  WORD|STRING

        Remarks        This command stores the contents of a word or string
                       VARIABLE. The $ variable prefix is not used in order to
                       prevent value substitution during script parsing. If
                       the string contains embedded quote characters, use the
                       other quote character (IE., single ' and double "
                       quotes) to enclose the string.

        See also       STRING

        Example        ASSIGN 0 TEST               ;sets $0 to "TEST"
                       ASSIGN 0 "Test string"      ;sets $0 to "Test string"
                       ASSIGN 0 $1                 ;sets $0 to equal $1
                       ASSIGN THIS "John's Wife is Kathy"
                       ASSIGN THAT "$THIS"         ;needs quotes because of
                                                   ;spaces and quote embedded

        BEEP

        Function       Produce a sound through the speaker.

        Declaration    BEEP  TONE

        Remarks        TONE is an explicit numeric value or variable and
                       specifies the frequency in Hertz (cycles/sec). The
                       sound lasts approximately 1/5 sec. Multiple BEEP
                       commands may be grouped together to produce more
                       meaningful sounds (IE., alarms). If TONE is
                       non-numeric, an error occurs.

        Example        BEEP    1200    ;a 1200 Hz tone
                       BEEP    1400    ;a 1400 Hz tone
                       STRING TONE     ;define a new variable called TONE

        BOX

        Function       Draw a Box on the screen and set the logical screen
                       dimensions.

        Declaration    BOX  C1  R1  C2  R2

        Remarks        This command is used to define an on-screen logical
                       window. The window is defined by its upper left corner
                       at row R1, column C1, and its bottom right corner at
                       row R2, column C2. Row and column values must be
                       explicit numeric values or variables, separated by
                       spaces or commas.

                       After a BOX or WINDOW command, the output of screen
                       display commands (except ATWRITE) is restricted to the
                       area defined in the BOX command.

                       Coordinates values are not verified; you must insure
                       that C2>C1, R2>R1, and all four values are valid screen
                       locations.

                       The upper left corner of the screen is at coordinates
                       1,1.

        See also       WINDOW;, GETSCR, PUTSCR

        Example        BOX 1,1,80,24       ;opens a window the full size of
                       the screen.
                       BOX 20,4,60,8       ;opens a window 40 cols wide by 4
                                           ;lines high.
                       BOX 20 4 60 8       ;same as above without comma
                                           ;delimited.

                       If you have an EGA or VGA display, the lower right
                       corner may vary with the screen dimensions (See Alt-2
                       or Alt-4).

        BREAK

        Function       Send the UART BREAK signal.

        Declaration    BREAK

        Remarks        The BREAK command sends the UART Break signal for 1.5
                       seconds (or the timer value defined by Alt-N/D/B).
                       BREAK is the script equivalent of the Ctrl-End command.

        Example        BREAK       ;Send the break signal

        CAPTURE

        Function       Open a File to capture all terminal I/O.

        Declaration    CAPTURE  FILENAME

        Remarks        The filename should be a fully qualified, valid DOS
        filename.      FILENAME must be a word or string variable. If the
                       drive and path are omitted, the current drive:\path is
                       assumed. If the file exists, data will be added to the
                       end of it (appended). If the file does not exist, it
                       will be created.

                       To close the capture file, use the TURNOFF CAPTURE
                       command.

                       CAPTURE is the script equivalent of the Ctrl-Home
                       command.

        See also       TURNOFF

        Example        CAPTURE C:\QMODEM\TEXT\CAPDATA.DAT
                       CAPTURE THISFILE.DAT        ;in the current directory
                       TURNOFF CAPTURE

        CHDIR

        Function       Change to a new Drive:\Directory.

        Declaration    CHDIR  DIRECTORY

        Remarks        This command is used to change the default DOS
                       directory to that specified in the DIRECTORY variable.
                       DIRECTORY must be a word or string variable. If a new
                       drive specification is included in the DIRECTORY
                       variable, the current drive will also be changed.

                       CHDIR is the equivalent of the Alt-O command (and of
                       the Alt-L command if the drive is changed).

        See also       DRIVE

        Example        CHDIR \                 ;change to the root directory
                       CHDIR C:\QMODEM         ;change to C:\QMODEM

        CLRSCR

        Function       Clear the logical screen.

        Declaration    CLRSCR

        Remarks        CLRSCR clears the current active window. If a WINDOW or
                       BOX command has not been issued, the entire screen is
                       cleared. CLRSCR is the script equivalent of the Alt-C
                       command.

        See also       BOX, WINDOW

        Example        CLRSCR              ;clear the screen

        COLOR

        Function       Defines the color of displayed text.

        Declaration    COLOR  ATTRIBUTE

        Remarks        This command sets both foreground and background colors
                       with a single attribute. ATTRIBUTE is an explicit
                       numeric value or variable. The following values are
                       needed to compute the color attribute:

                       0  Black         8 Dark Gray        +128  Blink
                       1  Blue          9 Light Blue
                       2  Green        10 Light Green
                       3  Cyan         11 Light Cyan
                       4  Red          12 Light Red

                       6  Brown        14 Yellow
                       7  Light Gray   15 White

                       Foreground colors may be 0 thru 15; background colors
                       may be 0 thru 7. To compute the correct attribute, use
                       the following formula:

                       ATTRIBUTE = Foreground + (16 * Background)

                       For a blinking foreground, add 128 to the attribute. To
                       help you, we have included a Script called COLORS.SCR
                       on Utilities Disk. Run this script to view all
                       available combinations and values.

        DEBUG

        Function       Enable or disable the Internal Script Debugger.

        Declaration    DEBUG  ON|OFF

        Remarks        The DEBUG command is useful in developing complex
                       scripts since you can trace script execution on-screen
                       and in real-time mode. DEBUG is OFF by default when a
                       script starts.

        Example        DEBUG ON   ;Turn it on
                           - - - execute script commands - - -
                       DEBUG OFF  ;Turn it back off

        Remarks        DELAYVALUE is an explicit value or numeric variable
                       containing the duration of the delay in milliseconds
                       (1000 = 1 second). This is similar to the PAUSE
                       command, but no characters are displayed during a
                       DELAY. You might want to use this command when building

        Remarks        The DIAL command is used to call one or more entries
                       stored in the phone directory. DIALSTRING is a string
                       or string variable in the same format as the Tag
                       Multiple entry in the Alt-D directory display. Please
                       refer to the Tag Multiple command under Alt-D for
                       additional information.

        Example        DIAL "1"        ;dial entry number 1.
                       DIAL "TMustang" ;dial all numbers that match
                                       ;the text "MUSTANG".
                       DIAL "PA1B PA2" ;dial 1 & 2 with Prefix
                                       ;modifiers.

        Restrictions   If a script is linked to the entry being dialed, it
                       will not be executed. All commands to be executed must
                       be defined in the script file which contains the DIAL
                       command.

        Example        SEND "ATDT 1 319 266-0540^M"    ;dial the number
                       WAITFOR "CONNECT"               ;wait for connect
                       - - -                           ;more commands

                       DIAL keeps dialing the same entry until a connection is
                       established. To dial a number once without re-tries,
                       use the SEND command with the appropriate modem dialing
                       string.

                       If you sort the phone book and make explicit reference
                       to entry numbers, be sure to reflect the changes in
                       your script's DIAL commands. To dial an entry
                       regardless of its number, use the Text Match tagging
                       method.

        DISPLAY

        Function       Display a line of text on the screen.

        Declaration    DISPLAY  TEXT

        Remarks        The TEXTSTRING string or string variable is displayed
                       at the current cursor position and in the current
                       color. Following the DISPLAY, the cursor is located
                       after the last character in TEXTSTRING. The text is not
                       sent to the serial port. The cursor position is set by
                       default following a DISPLAY, DISPLAYLN, NOTE or ATWRITE
                       statement, or by the user with a GOTOXY statement. The
                       color is the screen's default, or is set by the user
                       with a COLOR statement.

        See also       ATWRITE, COLOR, DISPLAYLN, GOTOXY, NOTE

        Example        GETSCR              ;save the screen

                       DISPLAY is similar to the basic statement PRINT "Text";
                       (note the semicolon) which does not automatically
                       re-position the cursor to the next line and allows
                       concatenation of displayed strings on the screen.

        DISPLAYLN

        Function       Display a line of text on the screen.

        Declaration    DISPLAYLN  TEXT

        Remarks        The text defined by TEXT is displayed at the current
                       cursor position and in the current color. Following the
                       display, the cursor is located on the first column of
                       the next line in the logical screen. The text is not
                       sent to the serial port. Original cursor location and
                       color is described under the DISPLAY command.

                       DISPLAYLN is similar to the basic PRINT "Text"
                       statement (note lack of a trailing semicolon) which
                       relocates the cursor to beginning of the next line
                       after printing.

        DOS
        BIGDOS

        Function       Execute a DOS command.

        Declaration    DOS  COMMAND
                       BIGDOS  COMMAND

        Remarks        DOS is the script equivalent of the Alt-R command; it
                       invokes the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE DOS Shell, and it is
                       subjected to the same limitations. Please refer to the
                       Alt-R command for additional information on the DOS
                       Shell. COMMAND must be a word, string, or string
                       variable.

                       The DOS command disables the Optimum Shell
                       (Alt-N/O/R/O) for the duration of the command. The
                       BIGDOS leaves this enabled if so set in the Setup. Each
                       has an advantage.

                       DOS is faster if you do not have sufficient EMS memory
                       because it will swap a large file to disk. BIGDOS makes
                       almost 220 more K available during the Shell. If you
                       have lots of EMS, then you most certainly will want to
                       use BIGDOS.

        Example        DOS "Copy text.doc PRN" ;copy a doc file to
                                               ;the printer.

                       BIGDOS "123"            ;run Lotus 123 with lots of 
                                               ;free memory.

                       DOS "type text.doc|more"    ;even pipes and
                                                   ;redirection work!

                       BIGDOS "COMMAND"    ;will invoke the command prompt 
                                           ;until EXIT is entered, just
                                           ;like Alt-R

        DOWNLOAD

        Function       Receive a file.

        Declaration    DOWNLOAD  PROTOCOL  FILENAME  [ASCII options]

        Remarks        DOWNLOAD is the script equivalent of the PgDn command.
                       PROTOCOL must be one of the internal or external file
                       transfer protocols defined to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.
                       FILENAME must be fully qualified (include the drive and
                       path) or it will be saved in the current directory. In
                       the case of Batch transfer protocols (Y, G and Z), the
                       FILENAME is actually a PATH and must be specified.

                       Status information is shown in a window while the
                       transfer takes place.

                       Internal Protocols:

                           A   ASCII               X   Xmodem
                           C   Xmodem CRC          R   Relaxed Xmodem
                           O   Xmodem-1K           F   Xmodem-1K/G
                           Y   Ymodem Batch        G   Ymodem/G Batch
                           Z   Zmodem Batch

                       ASCII downloads can have optional parameters to aid in
                       conversion from one system to another. They can be
                       specified in any order and are not case sensitive. The
                       parameters are:

                       XLATE=[ON|OFF]          Sets translate table usage.
                       CR=[NONE|STRIP|ADDLF]   Sets CR handling options.
                       LF=[NONE|STRIP|ADDCR]   Sets LF handling options.

        See also       UPLOAD

        Example        DOWNLOAD Y C:\QMODEM\   ;Batch Ymodem download
                       CHDIR  C:\QMODEM            ;change directory
                       DOWNLOAD C QM42SST.ZIP      ;put in current directory

                       DOWNLOAD A Filename XLATE=on CR=addlf LF=strip

                       This will filter the incoming data through the Input
                       Translate Table, add one LF after each CR, and strip
                       all LF's as it saves to FILENAME.

                       When using the ASCII protocol, QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
                       must receive a ^Z (EOF) character or the download will
                       never terminate.

        DRIVE

        Function       Change the default drive.

        Declaration    DRIVE  LETTER

        Remarks        DRIVE changes the default logged drive, but does not
                       switch directories as does the CHDIR command. LETTER is
                       any valid drive letter in your system (A-Z), including
                       those defined with the DOS SUBST command.

                       DRIVE is the equivalent of the Alt-L command.

        See also       CHDIR

        Example        DRIVE A ; switch to the A: floppy drive
                       DRIVE C ; switch to the C: drive
                       DRIVE Z ; switch to the Z: drive

        EGA

        Function       Change screen size on systems equipped with EGA or VGA
                       display adapters.

        Declaration    EGA  25|43|50

        Remarks        EGA changes the number of screen lines to the new value
                       specified in the command (43 and 50 are interchangeable
                       to remain compatible with previous releases of QMODEM
                       4.5 TEST DRIVE). If 43 or 50 is specified, EGA systems
                       will switch to an 80x43 screen size, while VGA cards
                       will switch to 80x50.

                       EGA is the equivalent of the Alt-2 and Alt-4 commands.

        Restrictions   This command is ignored if no EGA or VGA is present.

        Example        EGA 43  ;switch to 80x43 (EGA) or 80x50 (VGA).
                       EGA 25  ;switch to 80x25 for both EGA and VGA.

                       The screen will be cleared after each EGA command.

        EXIST

        Function       Conditional branch depending on the presence of a file.

        Declaration    EXIST  FILENAME  LABEL

        Remarks        If FILENAME is found, the script will  jump to the
                       location in LABEL. If a wildcard filename is passed, at
                       least one match will set the $SUCCESS flag and a jump
                       to LABEL occurs. If there are no matches, the $FAIL
                       flag is set and script execution will continue with the
                       next sequential statement.

        EXIT

        Function       Terminates the script and returns to terminal mode.

        Declaration    EXIT

        Remarks        The script is unconditionally stopped, and control
                       returns to QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

        See also       RETURN

        Remarks        FKEY executes the command stored in the current
                       function key file. The function key and shift state are
                       defined by the explicit numeric value or variable
                       KEYNO, based on the following table:

                            1 - 12 Normal  F1 - F12
                           13 - 24 Shift   F1 - F12
                           25 - 36 Ctrl    F1 - F12
                           37 - 48 Alt     F1 - F12

        Example        FKEY 27 ;send the string stored in Ctrl-F3.
                       FKEY 1  ;send the string in F1.

                       FKEY will execute commands stored in function keys 11
                       and 12, even if your keyboard has only 10 function keys
                       rather than 12. Refer to the Alt-J command for
                       information on storing commands into function keys.

        FLUSH

        Function       Clear the Keyboard buffer, COM port buffer, or both.

        Remarks        FLUSH clears data pending in the keyboard buffer (KBD
                       option), the COM port buffer (COM option), or both
                       (ALL). Any pending input data stored in the buffers is
                       lost.

        GET

        Function       Read data from the keyboard and store it into a
                       variable.

        Declaration    GET  KBDATA  COUNT

        Remarks        Input:   KBD
                       Output:  Screen and COM port

                       The GET command only accepts data from the local
                       keyboard. The data is echoed to the screen AND to the
                       COM port.

                       KBDATA is any valid string variable; its name is not
                       preceded with the "$" identifier. COUNT is an explicit
                       numeric value or variable which defines the maximum
                       number of characters in the input string. ENTER
                       terminates the GET command.

        GETR

        Function       Read from both the local keyboard and COM port and
                       store it in a variable.

        Declaration    GETR  KBCOMDATA COUNT

        Remarks        Input:   KBD and COM port
                       Output:  Screen and COM port

                       GETR is a superset of the GET command which also
                       accepts data from the COM port. Data is displayed on
                       the screen and echoed back to the COM port.

                       Parameters and coding syntax are identical to the GET
                       command.

                       If online checking is enabled with the TURNON ONLINE
                       command, GETR will check the modem for an ONLINE
                       condition. If the connection is lost (IE., carrier
                       drop), the variable will contain the string
                       "_OFFLINE_", regardless of the value in COUNT.

        GETSCR

        Function       Save a copy of the current screen in memory.

        Declaration    GETSCR

        Remarks        GETSCR saves a snapshot of the current screen for later
                       re-display with the PUTSCR command.

        Restrictions   GETSCR may be nested up to three levels deep. A
                       "nesting level" is defined as a corresponding pair of
                       GETSCR/PUTSCR commands. Beyond the third nesting level,
                       an error condition occurs.

        See also       PUTSCR, CLRSCR

        Example        GETSCR      ;save screen level 1

        GETX

        Function       Read data from both the local keyboard and the COM port
                       and storing it in a variable.

        Declaration    GETX  KBCOMDATA  COUNT  CHARACTER

        Remarks        Input:  KBD and COM port
                       Output: Screen

                       GETX captures incoming keyboard and COM data and stores
                       it into the KBCOMDATA variable. CHARACTER terminates
                       the input in addition to ENTER.

                       Unlike other GET commands which require a carriage
                       return <CR> to indicate the end of the input, GETX his
                       will terminate when one of the following conditions is
                       met:

                       CHARACTER is found in the input data,
                       COUNT characters have been received, or
                       ENTER has been received.

                       If online checking is enabled with the TURNON ONLINE
                       command, GETX will check the modem for an ONLINE
                       condition. If the connection is lost (IE., carrier
                       drop), the variable will contain the string

                       that tells how many new messages there are to read. You
                       want to capture just the number for later use in the
                       script. The message is in the following form:

                       ;"NEW MESSAGES (xxx)" where xxx is the number.

                       WAITFOR "MESSAGES ("    ;look for beginning of number

        GOSUB

        Function       Call a subroutine at a specified LABEL.

        Declaration    GOSUB  LABEL

        Remarks        GOSUB passes control to a routine identified by its
                       LABEL. Upon completion, the routine must use a RETURN
                       command, at which time script execution resumes with
                       the statement immediately following the GOSUB.
                       GOSUB/RETURN may be nested up to a maximum of 20
                       levels.

        Restrictions   SCRIPT commands and GOSUB/RETURN share a single nesting
                       process. Together, they may not exceed 20 nesting
                       levels in any combination.

        IF

        Function       Conditional branch based on the result of a test.

        Declaration    IF  STRING1  OPCODE  STRING2  LABEL (type 1)
                       IF  CONDITION  LABEL (type 2)

        Remarks        Type 1:

                       If the result of the test defined by OPCODE is true,
                       the script will branch to the routine called LABEL.
                       Valid OPCODEs are:

                       OPCODE  Test Performed
                       =       If string1 equals string2, goto label
                       <       If string1 less than string2, goto label
                       >       If string1 greater than string2, goto label
                       <=      If string1 less than or equal to string2, goto
                               label
                       >=      If string1 greater than or equal string2, goto
                               label
                       <>      If string1 not equal to string2, goto label

                       If STRING1 and STRING2 contain numeric values, a
                       numeric comparison is performed. If either is
                       non-numeric, the two strings are compared based on
                       their ASCII character values.

                       Type 2:

                       IF checks for a specific condition and branch to LABEL
                       if true. Valid conditions are:

                       $ONLINE     ;if Online, goto label
                       $OFFLINE    ;if Offline, goto label
                       $SUCCESS    ;if last operation was successful, goto
                                   ;label
                       $FAIL       ;if last operation failed, goto label

                       $ONLINE and $OFFLINE reflect the status of the carrier
                       detect (CD) signal. The ONLINE/OFFLINE indicator is
                       also displayed on the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE status
                       line.

                       The $SUCCESS and $FAIL indicators are set by the
                       following commands:

                       UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, CHDIR, DRIVE and HANGUP.

          =================================================================



                       The state of $SUCCESS or $FAIL must be set by one of
                       these commands before the indicators can be checked.
                       Once set, the state remains the same until it is
                       changed again by the completion of another eligible
                       command. Referring to either variable before it is set
                       yields unpredictable results.

        Example of     IF '$0' = 'YES' Yes_Label   ;if $0 = YES, goto
        (type 1)                                   ;  Yes_Label
                       IF "$0" = ""    Nul_Label   ;if $0 is empty, goto
                                                   ;  Nul_Label

        Example        IF $ONLINE Skip_Dial        ;go around dial if ONLINE
        (type 2)       DIAL "1"                    ;dial if offline.
                       Skip_Dial:                  ;continue...

                       S1:                         ;a label

                       IF $FAIL S1                 ;if failed, go try again

        INCR

        Function       Increment a numeric variable.

        Declaration    INCR  NUMVAR

        Remarks        INCR adds 1 to the value of a numeric variable. If the
                       value before the INCR command was 32767, the variable
                       will be set to zero.

        Restrictions   If NUMVAR contains non-numeric data, a script error
                       will occur.

        See also       DECR

        INKEY

        Function       Reads a single character from the keyboard or COM port.

        Declaration    INKEY  INDATA

        Remarks        INKEY reads a single character from the COM port or
                       keyboard (whichever is received first) and stores it
                       into the INDATA variable. Any keystroke or COM data is
                       valid and ENTER does not have to be pressed for the
                       script to continue. This command is useful to select
                       menu options, for example.

        LOADFON

        Function       Load a new Phone Book into memory.

        Declaration    LOADFON  FONFILE

        Remarks        LOADFON loads a new QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE phone book.
                       It is the script equivalent of the Alt-D/L command.
                       FONFILE should be a word, string, or variable
                       containing a fully qualified DOS filename with the .FON
                       extension. If the drive and path are omitted, the
                       current directory is searched. Refer to the Alt-D

        LOG

        Function       Open a LOG file to track QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
                       activity.

        Declaration    LOG  LOGFILE

        Remarks        LOG opens a QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Log file to which
                       activity is recorded. LOG is the script equivalent of
                       the Alt-0 command. 

                       Please refer to the Alt-0 documentation for further
                       information on the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE Log file
                       feature.

                       LOGFILE is a word, string, or string variable
                       containing any valid DOS filename. If the file exists,
                       data will be added to it. If the file does not exist,
                       the script will create it.

                       To disable the Logging feature in a script, use the
                       TURNOFF LOG command.

        NOTE

        Function       Display a message on the screen and log it in the
                       Capture file if open.

        Declaration    NOTE  TEXT

        Remarks        NOTE displays the TEXT string on the screen. If Session
                       Capture is active, TEXT is also recorded in the capture
                       file. If the cursor is not in column 1, then a CR/LF
                       precedes the TEXT to be displayed, forcing the cursor
                       to the first position of the next line.

                       Unlike other text display commands, the TEXT string is
                       NOT bound by quotes. The string starts immediately
                       after the first space following the NOTE command and
                       ends with the last character on the line (or the
                       semicolon which starts a comment field).

        OPENFILE

        Function       Open a sequential TEXT file for input or output.

        Declaration    OPENFILE  FILENAME  READ|REWRITE|APPEND

        Remarks        OPENFILE opens a standard ASCII text file for input or
                       output. FILENAME must be a valid DOS filename. Only one
                       file may be open at a time.


                       Parameters:

                       READ
                       Opens the file for INPUT with the READFILE command.

                       REWRITE
                       Opens the file for OUTPUT with the WRITEFILE command.
                       If the file exists, its contents are erased and its
                       length is reset to zero. If the file does not exist, it
                       is created.

                       APPEND
                       Opens the file for OUTPUT and positions the file
                       pointer to the end of the file. All data written will
                       be added sequentially at the end of the file.

        Restrictions   Only one file can be open at a time.

        POP

        Function       Remove the top entry from the stack and store it in a
                       variable.

        Declaration    POP  VARIABLE

        Remarks        POP is used to retrieve a value which was PUSHed onto
                       the "stack". The stack is an area of memory which can
                       store up to 60 values  (IE, text, number, etc...).

                       The stack operates in LIFO mode (Last-In, First-Out).
                       Thus, a POP command retrieves the item which was last
                       PUSHed onto the stack. Retrieving a value other than
                       the top one requires multiple POP commands.

                       POPping an empty stack returns a NULL string (zero
                       length).
                       PUSHing a full stack yields a script error.

        See also       PUSH

        Example        POP 0       ;POP stack into $0. $0 will be NULL
                                   ;because of no previous PUSH

                       ASSIGN 0 0              ;set $0 to zero
                       TOP:                    ;set a label TOP
                       INCR 0                  ;increment $0
                       NOTE This is $$0 [$0]   ;display the value of $0
                       PUSH $0                 ;PUSH it on the stack
                       IF "$0" = "10" POPSTACK ;test for value of 10
                       GOTO TOP                ;loop back

                       POPSTACK:               ;10 numbers on stack now
                       POP 1                   ;POP the stack into $1

                       IF "$1" <> "" POPSTACK  ;If not NULL, get another

        PORT

        Function       Switch to a different COM port.

        Declaration    PORT  PORTNUM

        Remarks        PORT switches the active COM port. PORTNUM is an
                       explicit numeric value or variable in the range 1-8. If
                       the port selected is valid, the current port is closed,
                       DTR is dropped, the new port is opened with the same
                       COM parameters as the old port and DTR is raised.

                       PORT is the script equivalent of the Alt-K command.

                       This command can be used to detect the active COM port
                       (the port to which the modem is connected).

        Restrictions   Valid COM ports must be defined in Setup (Alt-N/M/P).

        Example        ;
                       ; This assumes a Hayes or compatible modem
                       ;

                       PORT    1               ; select COM1 first
                       SEND    "AT^M"          ; send the ATtention command
                       WAITFOR "OK"            ; look for the response
                       GOTO    ON-LINE!        ; if successful, jump!

                       TRY2:                   ; next label
                       TIMEOUT 2 ERROR
                       PORT    2               ; select COM2
                       SEND    "AT^M"          ; send the ATtention command
                       WAITFOR "OK"            ; look for the response
                       GOTO    ON-LINE!        ; if successful, jump!

        PUSH

        Function       Place an item on the top of the stack.

        Declaration    PUSH  TEXT

        Remarks        PUSH stores an INTEGER, WORD, STRING or VARIABLE onto
                       the top of the stack. TEXT can be retrieved later with
                       the POP command. Please refer to the POP command for
                       additional details, restrictions, and code example.

        See also       POP

        Example        See the POP command.

        PUTSCR

        Function       Restores a screen previously saved with GETSCR.

        Declaration    PUTSCR

        Remarks        PUTSCR works in conjunction with the GETSCR command, in
                       a manner very similar to the PUSH and POP command pair.

                       PUTSCR restores the screen which was saved by the
                       GETSCR command at the same nesting level. The entire
                       physical screen is restored, as opposed to the logical
                       screen defined with a BOX or WINDOW command.

        Restrictions   Results are unpredictable if a previous GETSCR has not
                       been executed prior to the PUTSCR command.
                       GETSCR/PUTSCR may be nested up to three levels.

        See also       GETSCR

        Example        GETSCR  ;save the current screen

        READFILE

        Function       Read a record from a text file.

        Declaration    READFILE  INDATA

        Remarks        READFILE command reads one line of text from the file
                       opened with the OPENFILE command and stores it into the
                       INDATA variable. See the OPENFILE command for an
                       explanation and example.

        Restrictions   The Text file must have been opened with the READ
                       option or a script error occurs.

        See also       CLOSEFILE, OPENFILE, WRITEFILE

        RETURN

        Function       Return from a GOSUB or SCRIPT command.

        Declaration    RETURN

        Remarks        RETURN returns control to the statement which
                       immediately follows the GOSUB or SCRIPT command through
                       which the routine received control.

                       If there was no previous GOSUB or SCRIPT, RETURN
                       behaves like an EXIT command. To unconditionally
                       terminate a script, always use the EXIT command.

        See also       GOSUB, SCRIPT

        Example        GOSUB SUB1  ;call the SUB1 subroutine
                       EXIT        ;end the script

                       SUB1:       ;the subroutine SUB1
                       - - -       ;script commands
                       RETURN      ;end of subroutine
                                   ;will branch back to the EXIT statement

        SCRIPT

        Function       Call another script as a subroutine.

        Declaration    SCRIPT  SCRFILE

        Remarks        SCRIPT passes control to the script identified in
                       SCRFILE and operates identically to the GOSUB command.
                       If the script being called includes a RETURN command,
                       execution of the calling script will resume with the
                       statement following the SCRIPT command. SCRFILE should
                       be the name of a script file stored in the directory
                       specified in Setup (Alt-N/D/S).

        Restrictions   Up to 40 levels of SCRIPT and GOSUB commands may be
                       nested.

        See also       GOSUB, RETURN

                       RETURN                      ;return to previous script

                       The output of these three scripts (provided ONE.SCR was
                       executed first) will be:

        SEND

        Function       Send data to the COM port.

        Declaration    SEND  STRING

        Remarks        The text specified by STRING is sent to the COM port
                       and displayed on the local screen. The cursor will be
                       positioned after the last character in STRING.

        Example        SEND "^M"               ;send a carriage return (ENTER)

        STRING

        Function       Define one or more variable(s)

        Declaration    STRING  VARIABLE  [VARIABLE...]

        Remarks        Up to 60 variables can be defined with the STRING
                       command. New variables are referenced by prefixing them
                       with "$" (except where noted).

        Restrictions   Variables are stored in the order in which they were
                       defined. All user-defined variable names must start
                       with a letter.

                       If two or more variable names share the same beginning
                       characters, define the longest name first. Otherwise,
                       only the shortest name will be recognized.

                       For example, let's define three new variables called
                       $A, $AA and $AAA. To be able to reference all three,

        SYSTEM

        Function       Stop the script and exit QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

        Declaration    SYSTEM  X|Y

        Remarks        SYSTEM unconditionally halts script execution and exits
                       QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. It is the script equivalent of
                       the Alt-X command.

        TIMEOUT

        Function       Set a WAITFOR timeout value and optional routine label.

        Declaration    TIMEOUT  TIMEVAL [LABEL]

        Remarks        TIMEOUT controls the length of time WAITFOR commands
                       will wait for a text string. TIMEVAL is an explicit
                       value or numeric variable containing the timeout delay
                       (in seconds). If LABEL is specified, the script will
                       branch to that routine when the timeout delay expires.
                       If LABEL is omitted, the script will terminate with a
                       timeout error.

        See also       WAITFOR

        Example        TIMEOUT 3 AGAIN     ;set timer to 3 seconds, label

        TURNOFF
        TURNON

        Function       Change QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE operating parameters.

        Declaration    TURNOFF  KEYWORD  [KEYWORD...]
                       TURNON   KEYWORD  [KEYWORD...]

        Remarks        TURNON and TURNOFF are ON/OFF switches for QMODEM 4.5
                       TEST DRIVE functions or facilities which can affect the
                       operation of QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, even after the
                       script has terminated.

        UPLOAD

        Function       Send a file to the other computer.

        Declaration    UPLOAD  PROTOCOL  FILENAME  [ASCII OPTION...]

        Remarks        UPLOAD performs two basic types of file transfers;
                       ASCII and non-ASCII. FILENAME must be a fully qualified
                       DOS filename, or the file must be located in the
                       current directory.

                       Valid protocols are:

                       A ASCII             X Xmodem
                       C Xmodem CRC        R Relaxed Xmodem
                       O Xmodem-1K         F Xmodem-1K/G
                       Y Ymodem Batch      G Ymodem/G Batch
                       Z Zmodem Batch

                       All external protocols (defined with Alt-N/P) are also
                       valid.

                       For ASCII uploads, additional parameters may be
                       specified to override the Setup (Alt-N/P/A/T) defaults.

                       Following are the valid ASCII upload options:

                       PACECH=[NONE|character]
                       Specifies a pacing character which must be received
                       before the next text line is sent. The first line of
                       the file is always sent regardless of this setting.

                       PACESPEED=[nnnn]
                       The delay, in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second) inserted
                       between each character sent.

                       XLATE=[ON/OFF]
                       Specifies whether the outgoing file is (ON) or is not
                       (OFF) to be translated with the output translate table
                       (Alt-A-2) prior to being sent.

                       CR=[NONE/STRIP/ADDLF]
                       Defines carriage-return (CR) handling. This is normally
                       not needed unless the receiving computer does not
                       recognize the standard CR character (ASCII 13).

                       LF=[NONE/STRIP/ADDCR]
                       Defines LineFeed (LF) handling. Similar to CR, but
                       affects the LF character (ASCII 10).

          =================================================================



                       EXPAND=[ON/OFF]
                       If ON, adds a leading space to null lines (which
                       contain only a CR/LF pair) so that there is a leading
                       SPACE. This is a useful feature when uploading messages
                       to most BBS systems, which interpret a null line as and
                       end-of-message indication.

                       EOLCH=[nnn]
                       Defines the ASCII value of the End-Of-Line character.
                       It is very important to set this parameter correctly.
                       Since most ASCII files end each line with a CR/LF
                       sequence, the LF character should be defined as the
                       EOLCH (LF is ASCII 10).

        Example non-   UPLOAD O QMODEM.ARC ;send the file QMODEM.ARC using
        ASCII                              ;Xmodem-1K. The file must be in
                                           ;the current directory

        WAITFOR

        Function       Wait for a specific string to be received.

        Declaration    WAITFOR STRING

        Remarks        WAITFOR waits for the defined text string to be
                       received on the COM port. WAITFOR will wait the amount
                       of time specified in the last TIMEOUT command. If no
                       TIMEOUT command was issued, a default of 60 seconds is
                       used.

                       Each WAITFOR command may have a corresponding TIMEOUT
                       value for explicit control of timing and error
                       conditions. If this method is selected, all WAITFOR
                       commands should have an associated TIMEOUT command.
                       This will minimize unexpected errors (such as an
                       incorrect branch).

        See also       TIMEOUT

        Example        TIMEOUT 3 AGAIN     ;set timer to 3 seconds, label

        WAITUNTIL

        Function       Wait for a specified time before continuing.

        Declaration    WAITUNTIL TIME

        Remarks        WAITUNTIL suspends script execution until a specific
                       time of day. TIME must be in the same format as
                       specified in the Alt-N/O/C/T Time Mask.

                       While WAITUNTIL is in effect, the target TIME and the
                       current system time are displayed side by side until
                       they match, at which time the script resumes execution
                       with the next command.

                       If this command seems to fail, double-check the Time
                       Mask and what you have coded in the script.

        WHEN

        Function       Allows searching for alternate text strings while
                       WAITFOR is active.

        Declaration    WHEN STRING1 STRING2(type 1)
                       WHEN STRING1 LABEL(type 2)
                       WHEN (type 3)

        Remarks        WHEN may only be used while a WAITFOR is active.

                       WHEN (Type 1) sends STRING2 when STRING1 is received

                       WHEN (Type 2) branches to LABEL when STRING1 is
                       received.

                       WHEN (Type 3) immediately cancels all active WHEN
                       commands.

                       WHEN can be used in a logon (linked) script for systems
                       which change certain prompts depending on when you last
                       called. WILDCAT!, for example, changes prompts if you
                       call more than once during the same day.

                       A maximum of 10 WHEN statements can be active at one
                       time. WHEN statements remain active until they are
                       explicitly canceled by a blank WHEN, and are not
                       subjected to the TIMEOUT restrictions which affect
                       WAITFOR commands.

                       The first WHEN (Type 3) clears any pending WHEN
                       commands. The following WHEN (Type 1) commands identify
                       all logon prompts and their respective responses. With
                       this method, only one WAITFOR is needed; WHEN commands
                       handle all others prompts.

        WINDOW

        Function       Create a logical screen with user defined dimensions.

        Declaration    WINDOWC1R1C2R2

        Remarks        WINDOW creates a logical screen window. Unlike the BOX
                       command, WINDOW does not cause a frame to be drawn on
                       the screen. For additional information, please refer to
                       the BOX command.

        Restrictions   See the BOX command.

        WRITE

        Function       Send text to the COM port without a CR/LF.

        Declaration    WRITESTRING

        Remarks        WRITE sends text data to the COM port, but does not add
                       a CR/LF at the end of the string. This is useful when
                       sending prompts to insure that the cursor remains on
                       the same line. The WRITELN command is similar, but adds
                       a CR/LF at the end of the string.

        See also       WRITELN, DISPLAY, DISPLAYLN, SEND

        Script Error Messages

        Error messages, while not a pretty thing to see, are important in
        fixing the problems you may run across.

        CAPTURE Filename not found

        The CAPTURE command expected a WORD parameter and it was either
        missing or a STRING was specified.

        DOWNLOAD Filename expected

        The command was not followed by any text or the following text was not
        a WORD.

        DRIVE Letter A..Z expected

        The DRIVE command did not receive a character between A and Z as a
        parameter.

        EGA value must be 25, 43 or 50

        The value passed to the EGA command was not 24, 43 or 50. Use a
        correct value.

        ERROR opening FILE

        An error occurred in OPENFILE. Check the filename and correct.

        ERROR Opening Script File

        The script file was found, but could not be opened. Make sure the file
        is not locked in a network environment.

        ERROR reading from FILE

        An error occurred in a READFILE command. Make sure that the file
        contains valid data.

        ERROR writing to FILE

        An error occurred in a WRITEFILE command. Make sure the file is not
        locked by a network or multi-tasker, and that you are not running out
        of disk space, and try again.

        File already open

        Two OPENFILE commands were issued without an intervening CLOSEFILE.
        Only one file may be opened at a time.

          =================================================================



        FILE not open

        READFILE or WRITEFILE was issued before the file was opened with
        OPENFILE. Check the script logic.

        FILE not open for READ

        READFILE was issued against a file opened for REWRITE or APPEND. The
        file must be opened for READ.

        FILE not open for WRITE/APPEND

        WRITEFILE was issued against a file opened for READ. The file must be
        opened for WRITE or APPEND.

        FKEY Filename does not exist

        The filename specified in the LOADKEY command does not exist.

        FLUSH keyword not KBD, COM or ALL

        The FLUSH command requires the keyword KBD, COM or ALL. Correct and
        re-try.

        FON Filename does not exist

        The filename specified in the LOADFON command does not exist.

        GETSCR Nested too deep

        GETSCR/PUTSCR commands can be nested 3-deep. A 4th GETSCR was detected
        without a corresponding PUTSCR.

        GRAPHICS Keyword not found

        GRAPHICS was issued without a parameter or with an invalid one.
        Correct and re-try.

        Insufficient space for String

        STRING memory is exhausted. You have exceeded the memory of your
        machine.

        INTEGER expected

        The command expected an INTEGER value (-32768 to 32767). The variable
        or string was null or contained non-integer data.

          =================================================================



        INTEGER value required for INCR or DECR

        The VARIABLE argument in an INCR or DECR command did not contain an
        integer value. Check script logic and ASSIGN commands and insure that
        numeric data is stored into the variable.

        Invalid IF Opcode

        The IF command requires one of 6 comparison Opcodes. Make sure the
        Opcode is correct and that necessary quotes are used.

        Invalid KEYWORD or TOKEN

        The first word in the line was not a valid KEYWORD, or the KEYWORD was
        passed the wrong type of data.

        Invalid LABEL or misplaced Colon

        A colon ":" was found at the beginning of a line. This may be an
        invalid LABEL or the colon needs to be changed to a semicolon if the
        line contains a comment.

        INVALID OPENFILE mode

        An invalid parameter followed the OPENFILE command. Valid OPENFILE
        parameters are READ, REWRITE, or APPEND.

        Invalid Substitute VARIABLE

        The specified VARIABLE name was not found. Make sure the variable is
        defined with a STRING command before using it.

        Invalid UPLOAD keyword or keyword option

        One of the ASCII UPLOAD keywords was misspelled or contains an invalid
        parameter. Correct the keyword(s) and parameters and re-try.

        LABEL not found

        A LABEL was not found. Check the script for a possible omission or
        misspelling and try again.

        Line too long

        A script line exceeds 254 characters. Edit the Script and make sure
        lines are less than 254 characters.

          =================================================================



        LOADFON Filename not found

        LOADFON expected a WORD parameter. The parameter was missing or a
        STRING was specified instead.

        LOADKEY Filename not found

        LOADKEY expected a WORD parameter. The parameter was missing or a
        STRING was specified instead.

        LOG Filename not found

        The LOG command expected a WORD parameter and it was either missing or
        a STRING was specified.

        Off Screen Coordinates

        The Row and/or Column argument(s) of a GOTOXY command was (were)
        invalid. Since GOTOXY is limited by BOX/WINDOW boundaries, make sure
        you reset any WINDOW or BOX commands before assuming a full 80x25
        screen.

        ON or OFF parameter expected

        The DEBUG command can only be followed by the WORD ON or OFF. Correct
        and re-try.

        PORT selection invalid

        PORT expects a WORD in the range 1 to 8. It was either missing out of
        range.

        RETURN SCRIPT Filename not found

        A Calling script was not found when a RETURN command was issued (IE,
        it was deleted or renamed). Execution cannot continue. Check to be
        sure you are not deleting/renaming the calling script by accident.

        SCRIPT Filename not found

        A called SCRIPT file was not found. The script filename parameter was
        missing, or the file could not be located.

        SCRIPT/GOSUB nested too deep

        SCRIPT and/or GOSUB commands were nested more than 40 levels. Some
        serious thought needs to be put into the script(s) to reduce the
        levels of nesting.

        SETCOMM Keyword or Letter expected

        An invalid parameter was used in a SETCOMM command.

        STRING expected

        A command required a STRING, but it was either missing or a WORD was
        specified.

        STRING length 0

        A null string was used. The string must be at least 1 character.

        STRING not defined

        The string variable used in a command was not defined. Define the
        variable with the STRING command and try again.

        STRING VARIABLE expected

        A string variable command parameter was missing, misspelled, or not
        defined.

        Substitute Line too long

        String variable substitution yielded a line longer than 254
        characters. Use additional WRITE/DISPLAY/SEND commands to break up the
        line into shorter ones.

        SYSTEM parameter not "Y" or "X"

        "X" or "Y" are the only valid arguments of the SYSTEM command. Correct
        and try again.

        Target LABEL cannot be a KEYWORD

        A reserved script keyword was used as a label. Correct and try again.

        Too many PUSHes

        More than 40 values were PUSHed onto the stack without any intervening
        POPs.

        Too many WHEN's defined

        The maximum of 10 WHEN commands were active and an additional WHEN was
        issued. Use a blank WHEN command to clear unused WHENs and try again.

        The FILENAME argument of the UPLOAD command was not a WORD or was
        missing.

        WORD expected

        A WORD argument was expected, but it was missing or a STRING was used.

        WORD or LABEL expected

        A WORD or LABEL argument was expected, but it was missing or a STRING
        was used.

        WORD or STRING expected

        A WORD or string argument was expected, but was not found. This is
        usually caused by a missing parameter.

          FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

          Question:      When I start up QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE, the
                         Online/Offline indicator in the status line always
                         says ONLINE? Why?

          Answer:        The modem is sending a signal back to QMODEM 4.5
                         TEST DRIVE saying that it is connected to another
                         computer. On Hayes modems and clones that use the
                         '&' (ampersand) extended commands, there is
                         usually a command that controls the CD (carrier
                         detect) signal. The default mode (unfortunately)
                         is for the CD to be on all the time.

                         Check to see if your modem is supported in Quick
                         Modem Config. If so, then use that to configure
                         your modem and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE. If it not
                         listed in there, some of these hints may help...

                         To make things right, send the following command
                         to your modem from terminal mode:

                         AT&C1<cr>

                         You will have to check your modem manual to verify
                         this command in case it is not quite 100% Hayes
                         compatible.

          Question:      I make changes to the Dialing Directory but they
                         are not saved.

          Answer:        Changes made to the dialing directory are saved by
                         pressing the [F10] key. Please take a look at the
                         status line on the bottom of your screen, which
                         clearly indicates that F10 saves changes, while
                         [ESC] aborts changes.

                         As changes in operating procedures are made,
                         explanatory displays are updated to reflect them.
                         Please look at the screen more closely when you
                         encounter a problem; the solution may be a few
                         lines away and will save you a telephone call to
                         us in the process.

          Question:      Why does QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE turn on HALF Duplex
                         after I connect to a BBS? What controls the Duplex
                         mode?

          Answer:        There are four factors which affect Half and Full

                         Duplex (echo):

                         1.  The modem itself is set to echo. On most
                             modems, ATE1 will cause commands sent to the
                             modem to be echoed back to the system while
                             offline only. ATF0 will set local echo ON
                             after the connection has been established.
                             Usually, ECHO OFF is the modem default.

                         2.  Doing ALT-E causes QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
                             itself to provide local echo.

                         3.  Local QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE echo can be set in
                             the QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE phone directory.
                             Alt-D, then O to see the alternate screen. The
                             last column on the right is the Duplex mode
                             for that directory entry. Once you connect,
                             you will get echo if that column contains a
                             "H". Change it to "F" and press F10 to save
                             the changed directory entry.

                         4.  The Script commands TURNON ECHO and TURNOFF
                             ECHO can also play a role in setting the local
                             echo. This is usually the one everyone
                             overlooks! Check those Linked Scripts in the
                             dialing directory to see if these are set
                             wrong. This is the last place usually to look,
                             but it will pay to be sure!

          Question:      My HST modem does not connect with 1200 or 2400
                         non-MNP modems. Either nothing happens, even
                         though the connection is made, or I get a VOICE
                         return from the modem.

          Answer:        The HST always tries to determine if it is talking
                         to another HST first, then if it is talking to
                         another MNP modem. In some cases, this process
                         takes longer than the other modem's
                         carrier/training sequence (the high-pitch sound
                         the modem makes when it first answers your call).
                         As a result, the HST waits forever and eventually
                         times out with a NO CARRIER condition.

                         If you receive a VOICE return code, but the other
                         modem has in fact answered the call, it is
                         possible that background noise in the connection
                         is being interpreted by the HST as voice rather
                         than data.

          =================================================================



                         If you KNOW that the other modem is non-MNP, you
                         may use the AT&M0 command which effectively
                         disables the HST's MNP capabilities and makes it
                         act exactly like a standard 1200/2400 modem
                         without MNP. The AT&M0 will eliminate many of the
                         problems you may be experiencing connecting with
                         slower non-MNP modems.

                         To correct the VOICE problem, issue the ATX7
                         command (the previous setting was ATX6 which turns
                         on the HST's voice-recognition circuitry). This
                         will prevent the HST from becoming confused.
                         However, it will also prevent the HST from
                         recognizing legitimate voice answers.

          Question:      When dialing out of the phone book, QMODEM 4.5
                         TEST DRIVE does not switch baud rates to what was
                         listed in the directory.

          Answer:        This is directly related to the first Question
                         dealing with the Online/Offline indicator. If the
                         indicator is ONLINE when you go to dial from the
                         phone book (Alt-D), the baud rate will not be
                         switched because QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE assumes you
                         are already online! If you are Offline, then the
                         baud rate is changed before placing the call.

          Question:      My Hayes 2400B modem will not hang up reliably.

          Answer:        The Hayes 2400B and many clones come from the
                         factory with the DTR signal forced TRUE (always
                         on) and QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE wants to control the
                         DTR signal. The most reliable method for hanging
                         up, it to toggle the DTR signal going to the
                         modem. On the Hayes 2400 (and 2400B) this is done
                         by sending the following command:

                         AT&D2<cr>

                         Then, go into Setup (Alt-N/M/M/H) and change it to
                         the following:

                         DTR

                         Make sure the letters are capitalized and there
                         are no additional characters, just DTR. Then make
                         sure you exit and Save the Configuration
                         (Alt/N/E/S).

                         Now, when you press Alt-H, the modem will hang up!

          Question:      What's Ymodem/G and 1K-Xmodem/G and why is it
                         these protocols do not show up in the protocol
                         window when I do an up/download. What does it
                         take?

          Answer:        Ymodem/G and 1K-Xmodem/G are protocols which
                         assume that all error corrections are performed by
                         the modem hardware. Many modems are now supporting
                         the MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) error
                         detection/correction protocol, and most high-speed
                         modems use proprietary error correction techniques
                         at higher speeds. If you have such a modem, you
                         should activate CTS/RTS Hardware Flow Control via
                         Setup (Alt-N/M/T/C = ON). This will enable the
                         Ymodem/G and 1K-Xmodem/G protocols.

          Question:      What is an Error-Correcting modem?

          Answer:        Error-correcting modems perform error correction
                         and recovery on incoming data by themselves. This
                         is a feature usually implemented in the modem's
                         internal firmware (ROM, for example). The accepted
                         standard for internal modem error correction is
                         MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol), names after
                         the company (Microcom) who developed it. MNP is
                         not a "Fixed" standard, it is available in levels
                         1 thru 6, with MNP level 3 being the most commonly
                         available implementation.

                         For two modems to establish an error-free
                         connection, they must both support the same MNP
                         level. Higher levels of MNP, however, are
                         compatible with lower levels of the standard. Two
                         modems supporting MNP level 3 and communicating at
                         2400 (using the Bell 2400 standard) should
                         establish an error-free connection. Error-free
                         connections are usually indicated by the modem's
                         verbal or numeric return code upon connect.

                         A Multitech MNP-equipped modem may, for example,
                         return a CONNECT 2400/RELIABLE message, while a
                         USRobotics HST modem would return a CONNECT
                         2400/ARQ message upon connect. Although many
                         high-speed modems (IE, 9600bps and above) from
                         different manufacturers may support the same level
                         of MNP, they may use radically different encoding
                         modulation schemes to yield high data transfer




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   260

                         rates, which makes them incompatible at high
                         speeds.

                         For example, the Hayes, Microcom, and USR 9600
                         modems all support MNP level 3, but are unable to
                         communicate with each other at speeds higher than
                         2400 due to the incompatibility of their
                         proprietary modulation techniques. Most of these
                         modems will automatically "fall back" to the lower
                         speed (IE, 2400) where a reliable error-correcting
                         connection can be made.

          Question:      I press ENTER in the dialing directory, but it
                         does not dial the current entry. It dials another
                         entry. Why?

          Answer:        You have explicitly tagged entries in the
                         directory, probably with the space bar, and you
                         then moved to another directory location where no
                         tagged entries show. When you press ENTER, QMODEM
                         4.5 TEST DRIVE dials tagged entries. If NO entries
                         are tagged, then it dials the current entry. There
                         is a tagged entry count displayed at the top of
                         the Alt-D screen. If it is greater than zero, some
                         entries are tagged.

          Question:      I inadvertently sorted my directory. How do I get
                         back to what it was before?

          Answer:        Undo the sort by pressing Ctrl-U. If you
                         inadvertently sorted your directory TWICE, you're
                         stuck with a sorted directory. If you wish to
                         experiment with the new directory functions, make
                         a copy of your QMODEM.FON file before you start
                         QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE.

          Question:      I created a logon script with QuickLearn and it
                         does not work.

          Answer:        It is likely that you captured time- or
                         environment-dependent information in the script.
                         For example, one of the prompts captured by
                         QuickLearn contains the amount of time left during
                         your online session.

                         Edit the script manually to remove that part of
                         the prompt. QuickLearn is quick and easy, but it
                         is not intelligent. It records everything that
                         happens between you and the other computer and




          MSI                   QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE                   261

                         faithfully replicates it in the script, warts and
                         all.

                         This can cause problems if prompts change or if
                         they contain information that's not likely to be
                         there -- or that will change -- the next time you
                         call.

          Question:      The Host mode seems to "run away" as soon as it's
                         started!

          Answer:        This is another common problem people are
                         experiencing. The cause is always that the modem
                         is not reporting the true state of the CD (Carrier
                         Detect) signal coming from the modem.

                         For the Host to operate correctly, the CD signal
                         is checked to see when a user is online or has
                         disconnected. Because the Host can be started when
                         you are already online, this can be disastrous if
                         the modem is not set up correctly!

                         The usual symptom is that the Host takes right
                         off, answering its own questions with the text it
                         is displaying (or trying to display). This is
                         because the modem Echo (ATE1) is the default and
                         the host thinks someone is really online.

                         Check your status line before pressing Alt-5. If
                         it says ONLINE all the time, this is the culprit.

                         To cure the problem:

                         If your modem has DIP switches, look in the modem
                         manual for the one that controls the CD signal and
                         change it so that the modem reports the true state
                         of the CD.

                         If your modem does NOT have DIP switches, it must
                         have what is called NRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) to
                         store its configuration. Most modems that have
                         NRAM use the &C command to control the CD signal.
                         From terminal mode, issue the following:

                         AT&C1&W

                         If your modem comes back and says "OK", you are
                         all set! The status line should then show OFFLINE.
                         Once the online/offline problem is solved, 99% of

                         your Host mode problems will go away.

          Question:      When dialing out of the phone book, QMODEM 4.5
                         TEST DRIVE does not switch baud rates to what was
                         listed in the directory.

          Answer:        This is directly related to the Online / Offline
                         indicator. If the indicator is ONLINE when you go
                         to dial from the phone book (Alt-D), the baud rate
                         will not be switched because QMODEM 4.5 TEST DRIVE
                         assumes you are already online! If you are
                         Offline, then the baud rate is changed before
                         placing the call.
