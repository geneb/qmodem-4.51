## Miscellaneous Tools

These source code files were moved to their own directory (src\tools) as none are part of QMODEM or QINSTALL.

* 4XTO45.PAS   - Converts phone book (.FON) files from Qmodem 4.x to Qmodem 4.5TD.
* CASH.PAS     - Program to display a "REGISTER QMODEM TODAY" message.  Also includes something similar for Wildcat!
* CNVRTFON.PAS - Converts phone book files prior to v4.0 to Qmodem v4. Maybe.
* CONV-CNF.PAS - Converts configuration from Qmodem v2.0-v2.3 or v3.0-v3.1 to v3.1a
* FIXNOTES.PAS - Fixes phone book files that had been inadvertently corrupted by some new code. Dated 3/19/90, but no version listed.
* ISIPLUS.PAS  - A TSR to show information about the ISI multi-port serial card. (I think)
* LISTCNF.PAS  - Incomplete utility to display the contents of the QMODEM.CNF file.
* MAKE.PAS     - Recreates the MSG.ASM file from an input file.  The input file has not been found.

* REGPLUS.PAS  - Utility to generate Qmodem v4.5 TD registration keys based on text input.  Qmodem can be registered with this code by running "qmodem /register"
* SCRFIX.PAS   - Fixes Qmodem script files that use the SEND and WHEN commands.
* TMARK.PAS    - Generates a file with the current time and date as the contents.
