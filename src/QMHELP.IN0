!Topic 32  Dialing another System      
!Index 3

Alt-D is used to pop up the Dialing Directory (commonly called the Phone
Book).  From here, you can Insert, Revise, Delete entries, attach Notes to
specific entries, and yes, actually dial out!

See also : 26 Dialing Directory (Alt-D)
!Topic 5 File Allocation Window (FAW)
!NoIndex

The File Allocation Window is a common entry point in Qmodem for various
operations that require you to enter/change a filename.  (called FAW for
short).  It uses a simple line editor similar to the one used in the Batch
Entry Window (BEW).

When you have the FAW open, you should type a valid filename in the form:
DRIVE:\PATH\FILENAME.EXT

Editing Commands:

  ^Left arrow  -  Previous Word        ^Right arrow -  Next Word
   Left arrow  -  Left One Character    Right arrow -  Right One Character
   Home        -  Beginning of Line     End         -  End of Line
   Ins         -  Insert/Overwrite      Del         -  Delete Char at cursor
   Backspace   -  Delete Char Left      Enter       -  End Editing
   ESC         -  Cancel and Exit

NOTE 1: File/directory defaults followed by an * in the Alt-N configuration
menus can be overridden temporarily in the FAW.  These overrides will remain
in effect until:

   1.  Qmodem is stopped and restarted.
   
   2.  A new default is specified with the Alt-N function.  For additional
       information, see the help screens for the Alt-N/D and Alt-N/F
       commands.

NOTE 2: Batch Download Protocols do NOT require file names.  By definition,
only a DRIVE:\PATH\ specification is required for batch downloads.
!Topic 10 Function Key Macros
!Noindex

The Alt-J Window will display up to 8 characters of all 48 function key
(FKeys) combinations.  Sort of like a Quick Overview of all your FKeys.
Depending on shift state, each function key may hold up to four values.  The
data contained in each FKey combination may be a set of standard keystrokes
such as name, password, or the special commands such as @HELP, @SCRIPT,
@EDIT, @DIAL, @SHELL, @SHELLX and @STAMP.  

Whenever a function key is pressed, the associated data is sent as if it had
been typed on the keyboard, or the command or function associated with it is
executed.

Qmodem supports multiple FKey assignment files.  A new file may be loaded
or created by pressing L while in the FKey display window.

Pressing a number from 1 to 4 will allow editing of the Fkey values, as
follows:

    1 Normal Fkeys   2 Shift FKeys   3 Ctrl FKeys   4 Alt FKeys

Pressing Esc will return Qmodem to terminal mode.
!Page

NOTE: To access all 48 FKey definitions requires an enhanced keyboard with 12
function keys.  Only 40 definitions are available for keyboards with 10
function keys.
!Topic 11 Function Key Edit
!NoIndex

The Function key edit window is displayed after the desired FKey
combination has been selected from the FKey display window.

To edit the value of an FKey combination, use the Up/Dn arrows to move to
the desired key definition.  Within the definition field, standard editing
functions are available and are displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Three special characters can be used in the FKey text:

   ^M  Generates a CR (carriage return or Enter key)

   ^~  Generates a half-second delay.

   |   When used as the last character, this will allow trailing spaces
       to be included.  The last | character is stripped before sending.

When the desired FKey entry changes are complete, F10 will save the new
definitions.  Pressing Esc cancels the Edit function and returns to the
FKey display window.  
!Page

The reserved words @HELP, @DIAL, @EDIT, @SCRIPT, @SHELL, @SHELLX
and @STAMP can be used in FKey definitions as follows:

       @HELP          Invoke the Help System (you are in now)
       @DIAL x y z    Dial Directory entries x y z
       @EDIT          Invoke the internal/external editor (see Alt-N/F/V)
       @SCRIPT cmd    Execute Script "cmd"
       @SHELL cmd     Shell to DOS and execute "cmd"
                         (prompts for key-press before returning to Qmodem)
       @SHELLX cmd    Shell to DOS and execute "cmd"
                         (returns immediately to Qmodem)
       @STAMP         Add time/date stamp to the LOG file
!Topic 12 Download Protocols (PgDn)
When selecting the File Download function with the PgDn command, Qmodem
first displays the Protocol Selection Window.  The protocol is the method of
transfer of data between the sending and receiving computers.  The same
protocol must be selected in both computers or errors will result and the
transfer will abort.

Qmodem has fixed internal protocols and allows up to 10 external protocols.
External protocols require setup and are described in more detail in the
Qmodem manual and their own documentation.  The following Internal protocols
are available:

A ASCII - This is the simplest and least reliable protocol.  Data received
is not verified.  This protocol is used for text transfers and cannot be
used for binary file transfers such as .COM. .EXE, and .ZIP files.

X Xmodem Checksum - This is the most popular protocol for binary file
transfers because of its universal support.  This protocol performs basic
error-detection and recovery and has a 97% probability of error-free
transfers.  Xmodem transfers data in 128-byte blocks.

C Xmodem CRC - This protocol, similar to Xmodem, uses a better error
detection and recovery technique and is more effective under poor line
conditions, with a 99.7% probability of error-free transfer.

R Xmodem Relaxed - This protocol is almost identical to the standard
Xmodem, but error detection timing is delayed to insure proper operation with
online services such as CompuServe.

O Xmodem-1k - This protocol transmits data in 1024-byte blocks.  Under
normal conditions, it will transmit 10% faster than Xmodem.

Y Ymodem (batch) - This "TRUE" Ymodem protocol allows multiple file
transfers in a single operation.  Most batch protocols contain file
information and do not require that a filename be specified on the receiving
computer.

F Xmodem-1K/G - Use of this protocol requires an error-correcting modem, or
direct attachment of the computers with a null-modem cable.  This protocol
assumes that Flow Control between the two computers will be performed with
computer-to-modem hardware handshake.

G Ymodem/G (batch) - This is the non error-correcting version of the Ymodem
Batch protocol.  This protocol carries the same hardware flow control
requirements as the F protocol.

NOTE: Xmodem-1K/G and Ymodem/G will only appear in your menu if you have the
Alt-N/M/T/C (CTS Signal toggle) set ON.

Z Zmodem (batch) - This is the popular Zmodem error correcting protocol
that is sweeping the nation.  It supports Crash Recovery and does not require
an external protocol driver like previous versions!

NOTE: Qmodem features "Automatic Zmodem Download" if the Alt-N/P/T/Z (AutoZ
Flag) is set to ON.  In AUTOZ mode, Qmodem will recognize the Zmodem download
header record and will immediately start a Zmodem download. 
!Topic 13 Entries Commands 
!NoIndex

^SP/SP - Tag-P/Tag-Untag  Pressing the space bar marks the current entry 
-- a tag character will appear to the left of the name field --.  Entries
must be tagged before certain commands, as described later.  Any number of
entries may be tagged at the same time.  If ^Space is used to tag the
entry, a P tag will be displayed, indicating that any embedded Dial Prefix
modifiers will be ignored when the number is dialed.

I - Insert New Entry  Use this command to Insert a blank entry at the
current Scrollbar position.  All entries from the Scrollbar on are pushed
down and the last blank entry in the FON file is removed.

^D/D - Delete Tagged/Bar  Used to remove directory entries and/or the notes
attached to them.  A sub-menu is displayed when this command is issued, with
online help available.  Using ^D deletes all tagged entries, while D only
Deletes the current entry.  After an entry is deleted, the entries below it
are "pulled up" to fill in the gap.

^R/R - Revise Tagged/Bar  Allows editing of Dialing Directory information.
If ^R is pressed, all tagged entries will be edited, while pressing R
will only revise the current entry.  To save the revisions to disk, press
F10.

T - Tag Multiple  Tags entries based on number, number range, or contents.
Prefix codes may be inserted or changed on the fly.  See 103Tag Multiple for more help.

U - Untag All  All tags are immediately removed.

Q - QuickLearn  A QuickLearn tagged entry causes Qmodem to create a custom
Logon Script for that entry.  The linked script is played back automatically
thereafter, eliminating the manual logon.
!Topic 14 Upload Protocols (PgUp)

When selecting the File Upload function with the PgUp command, Qmodem first
displays the Protocol Selection Window.  A protocol is the set of rules
which govern the transfer of data between the sending and receiving
computers.  The SAME protocols must be selected in both computers, otherwise
errors will result, and the file transfer will likely fail.

Qmodem has fixed internal protocols and allows up to 10 external protocols.
External protocols require setup and are described in more detail in the
Qmodem manual and their own documentation.  The Internal protocols available
are the same as the 12 Download Protocols .

In addition, the internal protocols Ymodem, Ymodem/G and Zmodem have a
different filename entry screen called the Batch Entry Window.  For more
information on the BEW, see also: 89 Batch Entry Window 
!Topic 15 Adding Linefeeds (Shift-Tab)

Some bulletin boards and online services do not add linefeed characters to
carriage returns, which cause lines of data displayed on your screen to be
overwritten.

                Another scenario is when text seems to

                be displayed Double Spaced

                on your screen...


What do they have in common?  Both of these are controlled by the
Linefeeds (or lack thereof) in the text.  The Shift-Tab toggle can be
turned ON to correct the first problem.  If it is set ON and does not need
to be, then turning it back OFF corrects the second problem.
!Topic 16 Script QuickLearn (Alt-Q)

QuickLearn is Qmodem's automated Script Recorder.  A Script is a program
written in Qmodem Script Language, used to perform repetitive functions such
as log on, file transfers or other utility functions.  

While in QuickLearn mode, Qmodem captures data as it is received from the
remote system, as well as the corresponding local keyboard responses.  The
data is then used to build a Script File which, when executed, exactly
replicates the interaction between the two systems as it took place
originally.

Alt-Q starts QuickLearn mode with a prompt for the name of the Script File
to be created.  Any DOS file name is valid, and Qmodem will automatically
append the required .SCR extension to the script's file name.  Script
recording will then start.  When the desired functions have been performed,
pressing Alt-Q a second time will terminate the script recording and save
the script file.

The script just created can be executed with the Alt-F command.
!Topic 17 Directory Display (Alt-W)

Alt-W produces a sorted list of the current directory similar to the DOS
DIR/P display.  The default DIR argument is *.*, which displays all files. 
This argument may be changed and may include partial file names as well as
the wildcard characters * and ?.

Next, a DIR window will open with subdirectories and filenames listed.
Subdirectory entries are always shown in upper-case and filename entries in
lower-case.  You can use the cursor movement keys to scroll the window.
Selecting a <dir> entry that is highlighted by the scrollbar will move you
into that subdirectory and show any files that match the argument (commonly
called a file mask).  The entry .. refers to the parent directory.

If you have a large list of files, you can quickly locate an entry by using
Speed Characters.  Just type the letters of the filename and the scrollbar
will move to the filename that matches the characters entered.  The lower
left border of the window will show you the currently matching Speed
Characters.  If you enter more characters than match any entry, the Speed
Characters are erased so you can start over.

Pressing Esc removes the DIR window and returns you back to the Mask
window so you can change the mask or include a different drive letter.
!Topic 18 Duplex Toggle (Alt-E)

The Alt-E duplex mode, controls the display of local keystrokes on the
local terminal.  An incorrect echo setting will cause keystrokes to be
displayed twice like HHEELLLLOO, or not to be displayed at all.  In Full
Duplex mode, the remote computer echoes keystrokes and local echo is not
required.
!Topic 19 Dos Shell (Alt-R)

Shelling or Dropping to DOS temporarily suspends Qmodem and causes the
standard DOS prompt to be displayed.  Any valid DOS command can then be
invoked such as DIR, COPY, FORMAT and so on.  Sufficient memory must be
available in the system to allow this process since a second copy of
COMMAND.COM must be activated to process the commands.  
 
To return to Qmodem, type EXIT and press Enter.

NOTE: While in DOS Shell mode, DO NOT INVOKE RESIDENT PROGRAMS (TSR) such as
ProKey, Sidekick, etc...
!Topic 20 Screen Dump (Alt-T)

The Screen Dump function copies the screen contents to a filename specified
in the Alt-N/F menu.  Screen text is added to the end of the file and
includes Date and Time stamps.

If the file does not exist, a prompt will be displayed to create it.

Upon completion of the screen dump, Qmodem will display a completion status
window.
!Topic 21 Delete a File (Alt-Y)

This function will delete a file that you specify.  A valid DOS filename
must be entered in response to the file deletion prompt.

After the file name to be deleted has been verified by Qmodem, the complete
path/filename is displayed, as well as an opportunity to cancel the request.

Replying N to the confirmation prompt will cancel the deletion request and
return Qmodem to terminal mode.

Replying Y to the confirmation prompt will proceed with the file deletion.

This is a powerful and unforgiving command and caution should be exercised
or permanent loss of the file could result.  If the file was deleted by
mistake, it may be recovered with special programs such as Norton's
Utilities, Mace Utilities, etc.
!Topic 22 Scroll Back Toggle (Alt-U)

The ScrollBack toggle controls the storage of data in the ScrollBack buffer,
accessible with the Up-Arrow key.

By default, Qmodem starts with the ScrollBack feature active.
!Topic 23 Invoice for Ordering (Alt-I)

Alt-I displays an invoice form which may be used to register your copy of
Qmodem.  Should you experience any problems with Qmodem, send a message to
the Mustang Software and include this information.

Registration provides the best support possible, and enables Mustange
Software to constantly improve Qmodem.
!Topic 25 Communication Parameters (Alt-P)

Serial parameters include speed, parity, data bits and stop bits.  Default
serial communications parameters are set via Alt-N/M/C.  In addition, the
default parameters can be overridden in each entry in the Qmodem dialing
directory.

While in the COM parameter window, parameters are changed by typing the
letter corresponding to the desired change.  The current combination,
displayed on the window's top line, will reflect the change immediately.

Pressing Enter will implement the changed parameters immediately. 
Pressing Esc will restore the previous parameters and return Qmodem to
terminal mode.

CAUTION: Communication parameters can be changed while offline or online.
Online changes should only be attempted if the current parameters are known
to be incorrect, unreadable characters are displayed on the screen, or the
connection cannot be established properly.
!Topic 27 Change COM Port (Alt-K)

Qmodem can immediately switch between any one of eight communication ports
on computers so equipped.  The standard COM1 and COM2 ports are Qmodem
defaults; port definitions beyond COM2 must be specified with the Alt-N/M/P
configuration menu.

If you have defined additional COM ports, your menu may look something like
this:

                   ีอออออออออ Set COM Port ออออออออออธ
                   ณ Active COM Port is COM1         ณ
                   ณ                                 ณ
                   ณ 1  COM1  Base(03F8) Irq(04)     ณ
                   ณ 2  COM2  Base(02F8) Irq(03)     ณ
                   ณ 3  COM3  Base(03E8) Irq(04)     ณ
                   ณ                                 ณ
                   ณ Your choice : _                 ณ
                   ิอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

To select a new serial port, type the desired number from the displayed
list.
!Topic 38 Change Drive (Alt-L)

Any valid DOS drive letter (A-Z) can be entered in response to the Alt-L
command.  The current drive is shown in the drive selection window.

To change drive, type the desired drive letter.  The window will close if you
have selected a valid drive.  Press Esc if you do not wish to change the
default drive.

See also: 24 Change Directory (Alt-O) 
!Topic 29 Exit Qmodem
!NoIndex

               ***** YOU HAVE REQUESTED EXIT FROM QMODEM *****

                  Three options are available at this time:

    N  DO NOT EXIT Qmodem.  Select this option if Alt-X was pressed in
    error.  Qmodem will return to terminal mode.

    Y  Exit Qmodem.  Qmodem will close the Session Capture and Log files,
    if opened, and exit to DOS.  Qmodem returns to the default drive and
    directory active at the time the program was started.  If a connection
    was active, it will be immediately terminated.

    X  Terminate Qmodem without disconnecting the phone line.  This option
    can be used to run another program, re-boot the computer, or when not
    enough free memory is available to use the Alt-R Shell to DOS command.
!Topic 30 Translate Tables (Alt-A)

Strip/Replace is more commonly known as character translation.  Translation
may be necessary when communicating with another computer whose ASCII codes
do not match those used by your PC.

Incoming and outgoing ASCII characters can be changed to other ASCII
characters by editing the appropriate translate table.  Unwanted characters
can be eliminated or substituted to meet your specific requirements.

Binary file transfers and Xon/Xoff flow control are not affected by
translate table settings.

See also: 4 Translate Table Selection 
!Topic 31 Split Screen Mode (Alt-S)

In Split-Screen mode, the screen is divided into two windows.  The bottom
window displays data entered locally, while the top windows displays data
received from the remote system.  Due to its method of operation, Split
Screen Mode does not support terminal emulation and forces Qmodem to operate
in TTY mode.

While in Split Screen mode, local keystrokes are accumulated and are not
transmitted until a carriage return is typed.  Accumulated keystrokes are
displayed in the lower window.

NOTE: The characters ^M are used in place of the Enter key to produce a
carriage return if you want to enter more than one sentence before
transmitting the Buffer.

To return to full screen operation, press Alt-S a second time.  Qmodem
automatically restores the terminal emulation to its previous setting.
!Topic 33 Script File Execution (Alt-F)

Script Files are programs written in Qmodem's Script Language.  They are
used to automate or facilitate repetitive tasks such as logon, file
transfers, etc...

Type the desired Script file name in response to the first prompt, and any
required script parameters in response to the second prompt.  Press Enter
in response to the second prompt if the script requires no parameters.

The script will be loaded and will start executing following the second
prompt response.
!Topic 34 Terminal Emulation (Alt-G)

Terminal emulations allow Qmodem to imitate several popular stand-alone
video terminals.  Terminal emulation is usually required for communications
with minicomputers or mainframes.  The type of terminal emulation required
is determined by the Host computer.

The Alt-G command displays a Terminal Emulation window which allows the
selection of a new video terminal emulation.

To change emulation mode, type the letter corresponding to the desired
terminal type.  The screen will be cleared and the new emulation mode will
be displayed on the Status Line at the bottom of the screen.

 NOTES: TTY Emulation is forced while in Split-Screen mode.  Qmodem restores
        the previous terminal emulation upon exit from split-screen mode.

        ANSI is recommended if the remote computer supports ANSI Color
        Graphics.  (Such as the Forbin BBS)

        Qmodem's ANSI emulation is internal and does not require the
        DEVICE=ANSI.SYS command in the CONFIG.SYS file.
!Topic 35 Hang Up (Alt-H)

A Hangup window will open to confirm you really meant to hangup. (accidents
do happen)  Pressing Y or Enter will do the Hangup, while N or Esc
will cancel the Hangup request.

The Hangup command causes the modem to go On Hook and disconnect from the
phone line immediately.  The hangup command for the Hayes Smartmodem and
compatibles is: 

                  ^~^~^~+++^~^~^~ATH^M

Most modems can recognize the dropping of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
signal as a way of disconnecting from the phone line.  Modems can be set to
hold the DTR signal active High at all times.  In this case, Qmodem cannot
drop DTR to hang up.  The good news is that usually a modem command such as:

                  AT&D2&W

or a DIP switch can changed to allow the modem to use the more effective
DTR method.

NOTE: This command does nothing if you are already OFFLINE.
!Topic 36 Function Keys (Alt-J)

Repetitive keystrokes can be stored into Function Keys in each of four shift
states, yielding up to 48 possible combinations depending on keyboard type.
Keystrokes can be recalled instantly by pressing the FKey (or FKey
combination) into which it was stored.

In addition, Function Keys can be programmed to start a Script, invoke the
internal Full Screen Editor or even run external programs.

The Alt-J command allows the editing of the FKeys and loading new FKey files.

NOTE: FKeys are only active in terminal mode.  When issuing most Alt- or
Ctrl- commands, only the F1 HELP key is active.

See also : 10 Function Key Macros 
!Topic 37 Change COM Port (Alt-K)
!Noindex

Qmodem can operate on any of eight communications ports defined in Alt-
N/M/P.

COM1 and COM2 come pre-defined.  COM3 thru COM8 must be defined before they
can be selected.  If you are using any port above COM2, refer to your
Internal modem manual or Serial Port card for the correct settings.
!Topic 40 Script Parameters (Alt-F)

Following the verification of the script file name, Qmodem will issue a
Script Parameter prompt.  Script parameters are startup values passed to the
script, similar in purpose to DOS command-line parameters and switches.

Some scripts require parameters while others do not.  The need for parameters
and their format, if required, should be indicated in that specific script's
documentation.

If no parameters are required, press Enter and the script will start
executing.  If parameters are required, type them as documented and press
Enter.  The parameters will be passed to the script, and the script will
start.

NOTE: The script may be cancelled by pressing Esc then the A key.  Script
cancellation will return Qmodem to terminal mode in the environment set by
the script.
!Topic 42 Deleting Tagged Entries and/or Notes
!NoIndex

Deleting entries previously tagged completely erases the entries and leaves
their contents blank.  Since Note files can be attached to directory entries,
this command has two options:

Notes Only - This will delete all notes attached to the tagged entries.

Entries and Notes - This will delete the entries as well as the notes
attached to them.  Pressing Esc will cancel the Delete request and return
to the Dialing Directory display.

CAUTION: Unlike directory entries, Note files are not backed-up when changed.
As a result, Notes are deleted permanently and cannot be restored with the
^U Undo command.
!Topic 43 Dialing Commands
!NoIndex

ENTER - Start Dial  If entries are tagged, they will be dialed in the order
in which they were tagged. After a successful connection, that entry's tag
will be removed. If no entries were tagged, the current entry will be dialed.

M - Manual Dial  Use this command to dial a number which is not in the
directory.  You will be prompted for the number to be dialed. Manual dialing
is done outside the dial window and you will return to terminal mode after
this command.

Esc - Cancel/Exit  Exits the Alt-D window and returns to terminal mode.
!Topic 44 Xon/Xoff Toggle (Alt-Z)

Xon/Xoff are software-controlled transmit/receive signals which control the
flow of text or data.  While active, ^S will stop the flow of data and ^Q
will restart it.

Xon/Xoff is generally used to control text viewed on the screen or preventing
a data buffer overflow.
!Topic 45 Exit Qmodem (Alt-X)

The Alt-X command is used to terminate Qmodem and exit back to DOS.

Three Exit options are available:

            Y - Exit Qmodem and Hangup
            N - Return to Qmodem terminal mode
            X - Exit Qmodem and DO NOT disconnect the call
!Topic 46 Clear Screen (Alt-C)

Alt-C erases the screen and resets colors to their default values.

Default screen colors are not restored automatically if they were changed
during the execution of a script file.

NOTE: If a script has reset the physical screen dimensions, pressing Alt-C a
second time will also reset the screen to full size.
!Topic 47 View a File (Alt-V)

Alt-V is a Gateway to DOS, used to display or edit a file.

The default DOS program or command invoked with Alt-V is specified with the
Setup command Alt-N/F/V.  As is the case with the Alt-R DOS Shell, enough
memory must be available to load the desired program or execute the DOS
command.

The default program name shown in the displayed prompt may be changed, or any
valid DOS command may be typed.  When the program or command is completed,
Qmodem displays:

                        (Press any key to continue)
!Topic 48 Beeps & Bells Toggle (Alt-B)

Beeps and Bells are used by Qmodem to signal a given event such as a
successful connection or the end of a file transfer.

The default setting for this feature is specified in Alt-N/O/T/B.  The pitch
of the connect, download, or upload tones can be changed from the same menu.

Alt-B toggles this feature On or Off.
!Topic 3 Editing
!NoIndex

E - Edit Prefixes  Letters A through J may be used in conjunction with
phone numbers to define additional information such as calling service
account numbers or even alternate Modem dialing commands.  The desired
prefix and/or suffix letter is included within the entry's telephone number:
   
    A555-1212

In addition, prefixes may be used as Alternate Dialing Commands, if the
prefix itself is preceded by an end quote character `.  For further
information on alternate dialing commands, see ^^^Revise Prefix.

N - Edit Note  Qmodem allows text notes to be attached to each directory
entry.  Notes are stored in standard text files with a QMODEM.xxx filename
where xxx is a number from 1-200. This command allows creation/edit of the
note file for the current directory entry.

V - Edit Linked Script  This command allows editing of the script linked to
the selected entry.

NOTE: The N and V edit commands above invoke Qmodem's built-in text
editor.  While editing a note or script, the editor's online help is
available by pressing F1.
!Topic 50 ANSI Music Toggle (Alt-M)

Qmodem recognizes extended ANSI Music commands and will play it through the
system's speaker if the following conditions are met:

1 - ANSI terminal emulation is active (Alt-G).

2 - The music toggle is ON (Alt-M).  Extended ANSI Encoded Music strings
are in the following format:

      ESC[M.....music codes......^N
!Topic 51 FON Commands
!NoIndex

F - Find Text  Use this command to search the dialing directory and
Attached Notes for a specific text string.  The first matching entry will
become the current entry.

A - Repeat Find  Repeats the last Find command.  The search will resume
with the entry immediately following the current entry.

NOTE: If the matching text is found in an Attached Note, Qmodem will display
a status window to that effect. The N command may then be used to view the
contents of the note where the match was found.

L - Load  Load an Alternate Dialing Directory.  If the current Directory
has been modified, but has not been saved, a prompt will be displayed
allowing the current Directory to be saved.

NOTE: The extension of .FON is required to insure compatibility with future
versions of Qmodem.

O - Other Info  Directory Information Display toggle.  This command
alternates displayed data to allow complete viewing of entry information.


^P/P - Print 132/80  Produces a listing of the Dialing Directory on a
selected device or to a file.  Pressing ^P will print all directory fields
using 132 columns, while P will print selected fields using an 80-column
format.  To print the listing, reply PRN or LPT1 to the displayed prompt. To
direct the listing to disk, enter a valid DOS filename.  Entries with blank
Name fields will not be listed.

S - Sort  Directory entries may be sorted by Name or Number in ascending
sequence or by Total Calls in descending sequence.  A Total Call sort causes
the most frequently called numbers to appear at the top of the directory.

NOTE: The phone directory is sorted intelligently in case-insensitive
alphabetic order.  Entries starting with an UPPER CASE letter will be sorted
before entries with the same lower-case letter.  Entries which do not start
with a letter will be sorted in standard ASCII sequence.

^U - Undo  Restores the Dialing Directory backup file which was created
before the last major directory change.  If a backup file does not exist, an
appropriate error message will be displayed.  Only the LAST major change can
be undone.  If you wish to experiment with various changes, consider making
multiple copies of the QMODEM.FON file for backup purposes.
!Topic 52 Movement Commands
!NoIndex

Movement in the Phone Book is accomplished with the following keys:

Up Arrow  Moves the Scroll-bar UP one line.  This will wrap around to the
last entry if currently on Entry #1.

Down Arrow  Moves the Scroll-bar DOWN one line.  This will wrap around to
the Entry #1 if currently on the last entry.

PgUp  Displays the PREVIOUS page.

PgDn  Displays the NEXT page.

Ctrl-PgUp  Moves the Scroll-bar to the FIRST entry.

Ctrl-PgDn  Moves the Scroll-bar to the LAST entry.
!Topic 53 Pick List Windows
!Noindex

Many of the various windows use a Pick List format.  This allows more
information to be displayed than can fit in the windows physical dimensions.

You can select an item by several methods:

    1.  Using the cursor keys to move the Scroll Bar and pressing Enter.
    2.  Speed Selection by typing in the lead-in character(s).
!Topic 73 Upload a File (PgUp)
!Noindex

PgUp initiates a file Upload to the remote system.

Qmodem will display the upload protocol window, from which a file transfer
protocol must be selected.  Up to ten external file transfer protocols, if
implemented, are displayed at the bottom of the window.

Select the letter corresponding to the desired protocol.  The same protocol
must be used by the sending and receiving programs.

The remote computer should be ready to receive the file before starting the
upload.  The protocol selection window will be replaced by the File
Allocation and Upload Status windows.

Qmodem automatically scans the screen text from the bottom up looking for the
first valid file name meeting the FILENAME.EXT search criteria.  If found,
the name is inserted into the upload file allocation window.  If the match
was incorrect or none was found, the name must be entered or edited manually.

When the filename is correct, press Enter to start the transfer.
!Topic 81 Download a File (PgDn)
!Noindex

PgDn initiates a file Download from the remote system.

Qmodem will display the download protocol window, from which a file transfer
protocol must be selected.  Up to ten 10 external file transfer protocols are
displayed at the bottom of the window. Select the letter corresponding to the
desired protocol.

The same protocol must be used by the sending and receiving computers; make
sure that the remote computer is ready to send a file with the selected
protocol before starting the process on your end. The protocol selection
window will be replaced by the File Allocation and Download Status windows.

Qmodem automatically scans the screen text from the bottom up looking for the
first valid file name meeting the FILENAME.EXT search criteria.  If found,
the name is inserted into the download file allocation window.  If the match
was incorrect or none was found, the name must be entered or edited manually.
When the filename is correct, press Enter to start the transfer.
!Topic 117 Send BREAK Signal (^End)

The BREAK is a special modem signal used to notify the other computer that it
is to interrupt its current activity.  Certain online services can recognize
the BREAK signal and will respond to it appropriately.   When ^End is
pressed, Qmodem displays <<BREAK>> on the screen.  The timing can be set
via Alt-N/O/D/B.

NOTE: BREAK is a function implemented by the modem.  Qmodem only controls the
timing of this function.
!Topic 84 Setup - The top menu (Alt-N)

The Alt-N command invokes the online configuration program QINSTALL. 
Because Qmodem is extremely configurable, there are many options and
parameters that can be set to your preference.  If you are confused about any
of the Menu selections, be sure to use the F1 Help key!

Qinstall and Alt-N are used interchangeably.  If you are running Qmodem, then
pressing Alt-N will run Qinstall transparently.  If you are at the DOS
prompt, typing QINSTALL and pressing enter brings up the Setup Menu and
allows you to change the QMODEM.CNF file only.

The Alt-N Setup menu will look like this:

  ีอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ Setup Menu อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออธ

!Topic 83 Setup/Video
!Noindex

The Alt-N Video Menu has 7 options, 5 of which are preset color combinations.

The 82 Alt-N/V/C  Custom Color option allows total flexibility in the
assignment of screen colors.

The Blue, Red, Purple, Monochrome and LCD Laptop options are combinations
favoring these shades.

The 85 Alt-N/V/T  Toggles menu allows you to change things such as
Terminal Emulation, BIOS Video mode, Snow Checking and Growing Windows, to
name a few.
!Topic 85 Setup/Video/Toggles
!Noindex

BIOS Video - When set ON, all video I/O is done through the computer's
BIOS.  Some multitasking systems require programs to write to the BIOS to
handle the video correctly.  You should leave this set OFF unless you notice
a bleed-through problem.  Setting this ON will slow the video considerably.

Linefeed after CR   When ON, causes Qmodem to add a linefeed (LF) after
each carriage return (CR) character.  This toggle should be ON if text lines
are overwritten on the screen.  This toggle can be changed with the Shift-
Tab command.

Snow Checking - If you have an old original CGA video adapter, you may need
to set this ON to prevent the screen from "sparkling".  Any video adapter
other than a CGA can leave this set to OFF.

Growing Windows - When ON, windows that are opened give the appearance of
"growing" to full size.  This is purely for asthetics (commonly called a
Whistle or Bell).
!Page

Status Line - When ON, a Status Line is always shown on the last line of
the screen.  When OFF, the Status Line is only present when one of the
internal commands needs to convey command options to you.  The shortcut
toggle from Terminal mode is Alt-.

Destructive Backspace - When ON, the backspace will erase the character to
the left of the cursor before moving left.  When OFF, the cursor moves left
without blanking out characters.

Line Wrap - Controls wrapping of text when the cursor reaches the last
column on the screen.  When ON, the cursor wraps to the next line when a
character is written in the last column.  When OFF, the cursor stays in the
last column after a character is written.

NOTE: This Toggle only affects the ANSI, VT100 and AVATAR terminal
emulations.

Video Restore - When ON, the video mode in effect before Qmodem is started
is saved and restored when you exit.  When OFF, whatever video mode you are
in when you exit Qmodem is left active.


Jump Scroll - When OFF, internal code is used to scroll the screen.  When
ON, the BIOS is used to scroll the screen.  Usually the ON setting is
smoother visually.

92Emulation - The default terminal type Qmodem should emulate.  When the
cursor is located in this field, pressing Enter will open a Pick List of
available emulations. TTY or ANSI modes are the most common, while VT100
emulation may be required if connected to a Host computer.

Strict Color - In ANSI and VT100 emulation, there is a question on
how the default colors should be set.  Both ANSI and VT100 use the
Esc[m and Esc[0m command to reset to a color.  By the books, this
color is white on black.  In the past, these Esc codes were set to
whatever the default Screen Text color was as set in the Custom
Colors section.  But, depending on the system called, this may result
in an incorrect display of either ANSI or VT100 if the designer relied
on the white on black colors.

Alt-N/V/T/C (Strict Color) will control what color is selected when
Esc[m or Esc[0m is executed.  When set ON, the color becomes "white on
black".  When set OFF, it becomes the color set by "Screen Text" in
Custom Colors.  If you have this set OFF and some screen does not look
right, it might if you turned this ON.  To remain compatible with
previous versions of Qmodem, the default is OFF.
!Topic 87 Setup/Video/B|P|R|M|L 
!NoIndex

The Selections BLUE, PURPLE, RED, MONOCHROME and LCD LAPTOP are
predefined color schemes that favor their respective colors.

The last two are basically monochrome (i.e.. black and white) with LCD being a
variation that seems to be easier to read on certain types of Laptop
displays.  (your mileage may vary)

Selecting one of the predefined color sets puts them into effect immediately.
If this is not what you intended to do, simply exit Setup WITHOUT saving and
then restart.

The color set that comes up when you first start Qmodem/Qinstall is the
author's favorite setup and is not listed in the menu.  (smile)
!Topic 82 Setup/Video/Custom Colors

Custom Colors may be assigned to screen displays such as window text and
border, screen border, primary and secondary screen text, full screen editor
standard and highlighted text.

!Topic 77 Setup/Modem/Comm Parameters
!Noindex

This Menu allows the setting of the following communications parameters:

Default Baud Rate (A) - The speed at which Qmodem will open the default
serial communication port.  This value should match the modem's speed.
Supported speeds are 110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600
and 115200.  The default baud rate is 1200.  This is also the speed of which
the Host Mode is reset to between callers.

Default Data Bits (B) - Data bit values are usually 8 or 7, with 8 being
the most common.  This setting must match that of the software operating on
the remote computer.  Most PC Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) operate with 8
data bits, the default value.

Default Parity (C) - The parity scheme used to insure the reliability of
the data being received.  Parity values are NONE, EVEN, or ODD.  This value
must also match that used by the computer being called.  Most BBS systems use
a parity of NONE, the default value.

Default Stop Bits (D) - Stop bits are used to separate characters.  Again,
this value must match the remote computer's setting.  Most BBS systems use 1
stop bit, the default value.

Command Before & After Baud Chg (E&F) - These two strings are sent to the
modem before and after the serial speed is changed.  The default values are
blank.  Non-standard modems may require special commands.

Cycle Delay (G) - The number of seconds Qmodem must wait to redial
following a failed connection, such as a BUSY signal.  The default value is
45 seconds.

Timeout Delay (H) - The number of seconds Qmodem will wait for a connect
after dialing a number.  When this period has expired, Qmodem will instruct
the modem to hang up.  The default value is 60 seconds.  Also, most modems
have an internal timeout value which may be different from the one assigned.

Modem Command Delay (I) - The number of milliseconds delay between
characters in modem commands.  The default is 0.  Some high-speed modems may
require a delay (1-25) value if commands are not recognized and do not return
an OK message.

Serial Port (J) - The address (1-8) of the communication port to which the
modem is attached.  The default is 1.  Port addresses higher than 2 must be
configured separately via Alt-N/M/P.
!Page

Script SEND PACE= delay (K) - This controls the addition of the PACE=
parameter to Script SEND commands.  If this is greater than 0, QuickLearn
will add the PACE=xxxx parameter to the end of the SEND command.  The value
of xxxx will be be set to this option's value.
!Topic 76 Setup/Modem/Modem Commands
!Noindex

These are special parameters and commands used to control Qmodem's
interaction with the modem.

Initialization Command - Default: ATE1Q0M1X1V1S7=60^M.  This it the modem
command that is first sent when Qmodem starts.  It should setup the modem for
proper operation.  If you have run your modem through the Quick Modem Config,
then the proper Init command has been set for you.  This command may vary
depending on the modem; consult the modem owner's manual.

Prefix Dial Command - Default: ATDT.  Used to tone-dial a number on Hayes
and compatible modems.  This also varies depending on modem brand. Pulse-
dialing requires this to be changed to ATDP.  You can also toggle DTR by
having just DTR as the Prefix Dial command.

TIP: Adding *70 after the ATDT dial command can be used to disable call-
waiting on some tone-dialing phone systems.  Adding 1170 after the ATDP
dial command can be used on some pulse-dialing phone systems.

Suffix Dial Command - Default: ^M, a Carriage Return.  This command
immediately follows the number to be dialed.
!Page

Connect Message - Default: CONNECT.  This is the message returned by the
modem when a successful connection has been established.  Most modems will
also return the baud rate, e.g. CONNECT 2400.  Do NOT include the baud rate
as part of this message.  Doing so will only allow connecting at that speed!

Error Messages 1-4 - Default: NO CARRIER, BUSY, NO DIAL TONE and VOICE.
These are messages returned by the modem when the connection was
unsuccessful.  Refer to your modem manual for the messages for your modem.

Abort Dial Command - Default: ^M.  This string will be sent to the modem
when a dial request is cancelled.  Most modems accept ^M.  Using the command
DTR is the most effective method if the modem supports dropping DTR as a
disconnect method.  Consult the modem manual for information on this.

Hangup Command - Default: ^~^~^~+++^~^~^~ATH0^M.  This command forces a 1.5
second pause, then sends the +++ to get the modem's attention, another pause
and then the command to hang up.  Specifying DTR is a more effective method
if the modem supports dropping DTR as a disconnect method.
!Page

Redial Cancel Text - Default: RING.  The string sent by the modem which
causes the dialer to stop.  If your phone line is used for both outgoing and
incoming calls, and you wish an incoming call to cancel dialing in progress,
use the word "RING" in this field.
!Topic 74 Setup/Modem/Port Addresses
!Noindex

Qmodem supports default assignments for two serial ports, COM1: and COM2:.
For PC, AT and compatibles, equipped with IBM-standard adapters, port address
and IRQ assignments need not be changed.

IBM PS/2 units also support the COM3 and COM4 ports with the following
assignments:
                    Port #    Address   IRQ
                    ------------------------
                    COM3       3220      3
                    COM4       3228      3


On non-PS/2 machines, port assignments for COM3 and COM4 are non-standard.
Refer to the adapter or internal modem's documentation for specific hardware
information.  We have found, however, that the following setting usually work
fine:
                    Port #    Address   IRQ
                    ------------------------
                    COM3       03E8      4
                    COM4       02E8      3
!Page

NOTE: It is imperative that ALL serial ports be defined in this section, not
just those that have modems connected to them.  The reason is Qmodem may need
to disable other devices to allow the selected modem to function.  An example
will speak volumes...

You have an internal modem set for COM3:, Base 03E8, IRQ 4.  You also have a
new mouse that you have connected to COM1:, Base 03F8, IRQ 4.  Notice that
both ports share the same IRQ.  In a non MCA or EISA bus computer, this can
cause problems.  Qmodem gets around this by turning the mouse port off while
using the internal modem.
!Topic 71 Setup/Modem/Quick Modem Config

This is the feature you all have been waiting for!  Quick Modem Config
(QMC) allows you to select your modem from the Pick List for quick, painless
installation.  Under most circumstances, you only need set the serial port
with Alt-N/M/C/J and then your modem here and you are ready to go!

Depending on the modem you select, you may be prompted to change dip switches
or jumpers.  Be sure to follow the directions given!  Some features of the
modem may not function correctly otherwise.

Then, you may be shown a list of modem commands that QMC wants to send to the
modem.  These are also important for correct modem operations.  Reply Y to
send them or N to skip this step.  (Again, we STRONGLY urge you to execute
these commands.)

And lastly, you will probably be shown a closing message about any special
features of the modem that were enabled.

In all, you should be able to breeze through this in less than 5 minutes!
