
Qmodem .FON Conversion Utility (QMFONCNV.EXE)
=============================================

Just a quick note before you use this utility.  This program has not
been extensively tested but has been posted due to numerous requests for
it.  If you find a problem with the program, please post a comment to
the SYSOP detailing the problem you are having.

To run QMFONCNV, simply copy the program into your QMODEM subdirectory
and type QMFONCNV.  The only reason that the program needs to be in the
QMODEM subdirectory is so that the program can read the QMODEM.CNF file
for .FON book defaults.  If you wish to run this program in another
subdirectory, be sure to copy the QMODEM.CNF file to the same working
directory.

The rest is rather self-explanitory.  Happy modeming!
