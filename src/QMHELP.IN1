Xon/Xoff flow  A software flow control protocol used in the text and ASCII
transmissions.  This toggle can be changed with the Alt-Z command from
Terminal mode.  Software flow control is not used during binary file xfers.

CTS/RTS flow  When ON, implements hardware handshake flow control between
modem and computer.  This is required for high-speed and error-correcting
modems.  When OFF, no hardware flow control is used.  You must have this set
ON if you want to use the reliable xfer protocols such as 1K-Xmodem/G and
Ymodem/G.

NOTE: Qmodem will check for the presence of the CTS signal when started.  If
CTS is not detected, an error message will be displayed, giving you the
option to continue operating without CTS handshake, or to wait for the CTS
signal to become active (i.e. in case the modem was turned off or
disconnected from the computer).

RTS When Writing  When ON, causes Qmodem to maintain the RTS (Request To
Send) signal while writing to disk (during a download).  On 80286 or 80386
computers, this option will increase the download transfer rate by 1% to 2%
as data is being accepted from the modem during disk writes.
!Page

FIFO during Shell  If ON, allows 16550 buffered serial chips to accumulate
data during a SHELL operation.

Lock DTE Baud Rate  When OFF, this causes Qmodem to set the serial port
speed (DTE) to the speed of the modem connection, as returned in the modem's
CONNECT message.  When ON, the DTE serial port speed is constant regardless
of the CONNECT message.

High Speed Xmit  When ON, Qmodem uses an interrupt-driven data transmission
method for improved performance.  When OFF, a "brute force" method is used,
which is somewhat slower.  Some computer/serial port combinations may not
handle the faster mode, in which case this parameter should be set OFF.

16550 UART Enable  When ON, causes Qmodem to enable the 16550 and 16550A
UART FIFO buffer.  On 16550x equipped serial ports, this parameter should be
set to ON since buffering solves a number of communications problems when
running under a network or multitasker.
!Page

Init ignores CD  When ON, the Modem Init String is sent to the modem
regardless if the Carrier Detect (CD) signal is sensed.  This can get around
the problem where a modem needs to be told to not force the Carrier Detect
signal to the computer.  A majority of the modems can leave this set OFF.
!Topic 69 Setup/Host
!Noindex

The Host mode operates as a mini BBS, complete with electronic messages,
sysop chat, and file transfer capabilities.  The Host mode requires access to
specific Menu and User files.  Options include:

Type of System - OPEN, CLOSED, or CALLBACK.  An OPEN system allows new
callers.  A CLOSED system requires that all callers be defined in the User
file.  CALLBACK causes the system to hang up and CALL the user BACK as a
security measure.

Download Dir - Host mode download drive:\directory.  The host mode will
only allow downloads from a single directory.

Upload Dir - Host Mode upload drive:\directory.  All files received will be
stored in that directory.  This may be the same as the download directory.

Maximum time - The number of minutes a user is allowed on the system. After
this period expires, the caller will be disconnected.

DOS Password - The password required to use the Host Mode's DOS Shell.

Shutdown Password - The password required to shut down Qmodem from remote.

Init Command - A modem initialization string to be used specifically for
Host Mode operation.  A good default string is ATS0=0H0^M.

Answer Command - The modem command required to answer the phone when an
incoming call has been detected.  With Hayes and compatible modems, this
command is ATA^M.

OK Message - The message returned by the modem following successful command
execution.  With Hayes and compatible modems, the field should contain the
word OK.

Ring Detect - The message returned by the modem when an incoming call is
detected.  For Hayes and compatible modems, this field should contain the
word RING.

Busy Command - Command sent to the modem to cause it to go offhook when
the Sysop logs on locally.  This will cause callers to receive a BUSY signal
while the Sysop is logged on.  For Hayes and compatible modems, this command
is ATM0H1^M.
!Page

# Rings & Answer - This value controls how many rings to count before
sending the Answer Command to the modem.  If you want the Host to answer on
the 6th ring, set this to 6.  The count can range from 1 to 10 rings.
!Topic 68 Setup/Protocols
!Noindex

Qmodem supports up to 10 external file transfer protocols and configuration
of the ASCII protocol.  Common external protocols include Puma, Sealink,
Kermit and CIS-B.

The external protocols are implemented with separate programs whose
installation steps are also external to Qmodem.  Please refer to the
protocol's documentation for additional installation and customizing
information.

When installed properly, these external protocols are available directly from
the Qmodem file transfer protocol selection window.  Existing protocol names
are displayed in the window.  To create or 67 edit  a protocol definition,
select the desired protocol letter and press Enter.

Blank lines are not allowed between items in the external protocol list.  You
must define the external protocols starting with entry 0 working downward to
entry 9.  When you delete an external protocol by blanking out it's selection
character, all the protocols below are moved up to fill the void.

!Topic 67 External Protocol Edit
!NoIndex

The following fields are required to define an external protocol:

Select Character - The letter or digit used to select this protocol while
in the upload/download protocol selection window.  Protocol select characters
that are the same as the internal protocols will cause the external to
override the internal.

Protocol - The written name of the protocol as it will appear in the upload
and download selection window.

Upload BAT - The name of the upload batch file for that external protocol.

Download BAT - The name of the download batch file for that external
protocol.

Filename Prompt - Defined as Y or N depending on protocol requirements
for downloads.  Y will cause Qmodem to prompt for a filename to be
received.  N assumes that the filename will be sent as part of the received
data and handled automatically by the protocol.
!Page

NOTE: Qmodem passes the current DTE BAUD RATE, PORT #, DCE BAUD RATE and
FILENAME to the protocol batch file as parameters %1, %2, %3 and %4.  The
filename may not be required depending on the external protocol selected. 
Refer to the external protocol's own documentation for additional details.

Special parameters may be specified for ASCII (i.e.. text-only) file transfers.
ASCII transfers may be used for capturing textual data to a file or uploading
text directly into a message, for example.

Due to the nature of ASCII transfers and the various options available,
parameters can be specified for both 64 Transmit  and 65 Receive 
operations.
!Topic 65 Setup/Protocols/Ascii/Receive
!Noindex

ASCII Receive Options control the processes applied to ASCII Download
procedure.

Use INPUT Translate Table - When set ON, Qmodem will translate all incoming
ASCII data to conform to the Incoming Translate Table.  (See the 30 Alt-A 
command for additional details on the translate table).  If OFF, the data is
not translated and is saved to disk exactly as it is received.

Carriage Return (CR) Handling - Three options are available:

      1.  NONE    No special treatment of the CR. (Decimal 13)
      2.  STRIP   All CR's are removed from the file as it is saved.
      3.  ADD LF  Adds a trailing LineFeed (Decimal 10) after each CR.

LineFeed (LF) Handling - Three options are available:

      1.  NONE    No special treatment of the LF. (Decimal 10)
      2.  STRIP   All LF's are removed from the file as it is saved.
      3.  ADD CR  Adds a leading Carriage Return (Decimal 13) before each
                  LineFeed.
!Topic 64 Setup/Protocols/Ascii/Transmit
!Noindex

ASCII Transmit Options allow complete flexibility in uploading the data to
the receiver when using the ASCII Upload protocol:

Use OUTPUT Translate Table - ON or OFF.  If ON, outgoing ASCII data will be
translated according to the Output Translate Table (see 30 Alt-A  command
for additional information on translate tables).  The default translate table
causes no character substitution.  If OFF, the outgoing ASCII data will not
be translated.

Carriage Return (CR) Handling - Three options are available:

      1.  NONE    No special treatment of the CR. (Decimal 13)
      2.  STRIP   All CR's are removed from the file as it is transmitted.
      3.  ADD LF  Adds a trailing LineFeed (Decimal 10) after each CR.

LineFeed (LF) Handling - Three options are available:

      1.  NONE    No special treatment of the LF. (Decimal 10)
      2.  STRIP   All LF's are removed from the file as it is transmitted.
      3.  ADD CR  Adds a leading Carriage Return (Decimal 13) before each
                  Line Feed character.

Pacing Speed - The delay inserted between characters as they are sent,
expressed in milliseconds (1/1000th sec.).  Default is 0, no delay.  May be
used to slow down transfers if needed by the receiving system.

Pacing Character - The character which, when received, causes the next
line of text is transmitted.  If this is zero, then the transfer will not
pause between lines of text.  Also referred to as "Prompt Character" in
earlier releases of Qmodem.

Blank Line Expansion - ON or OFF.  If ON, causes blank lines (lines with
a leading CR and/or LF and no other data) should be expanded to include at
least one SPACE as a lead character.

End Of Line Character (EOL) - The character generated at the end of a
line by your text editor, usually in response to pressing the <Enter> key
to move to the next line.  Most editors use the LineFeed character
(Decimal 10), and it is usually preceded by a Carriage Return (Decimal
13).

Qmodem requires access to certain predefined files or programs whose paths
and names are specified in this menu.

Online Help  This is the full drive:\path\filename for the Qmodem Online
help file.  If you are reading this, it is probably set correctly! (smile)

   Example:  C:\QMODEM\QMODEM.HLP

Screen Dump  The file to which Qmodem screen copies will be saved.  Qmodem
automatically appends the .DMP suffix to the specified filename if one has
not been specified. 

   Example:  C:\QMODEM\SCREEN.DMP

Capture  The file which will contain the Qmodem Session data if this
feature is used. Qmodem automatically appends the .CAP suffix to the
filename if one has not been specified.

   Example:  C:\QMODEM\CAPTURE.CAP
!Page

Log  The file to which Qmodem activity is logged, if this feature is used.
Qmodem automatically appends the .LOG suffix to the filename if one has not
been specified. 
 
   Example:  C:\QMODEM\QMODEM.LOG

Scrollback  The file to which the scrollback buffer is copied.  Qmodem
does not add an extension to this filename by default.

   Example:  C:\QMODEM\SCROLL.SAV

NOTE: Qmodem will append new data to the screen dump, capture, log, and
scrollback files if they exist.  If they do not, a prompt for their creation
will be issued when the corresponding command is issued.  File names may be
changed when these recording features are invoked.

View  View is in fact a DOS Shell which passes control to an external
program.  The View field defines the command used to invoke that program, as
if typed on the DOS command line:

   Example:  C:\UTILITY\LIST

Two special @ commands can be used in the View field: @FSE and @EDITOR.

@FSE  Calls the internal Full Screen Editor for file viewing/editing.

   Example:  @FSE

@EDITOR  Lets you use your favorite editor instead of the one built in.

   Example:  @EDITOR QEDIT

NOTE: If the View field is left blank, the Qmodem Internal Editor will be
used as in editing scripts or attached notes from the phone book.  Also, a
SPACE will NOT be added automatically.  You must add a space if you are
going to be adding data to the Alt-V prompt.

Printer  This allows you to redirect the Alt-9 Print Echo data to a
different printer port or even a disk file.  When left blank, the default
printer PRN is used.

Examples include PRN, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, or even C:\PRINT.SAV.
!Page

Time/Date Stamp  Allows turning on and off the Time/Date header places in
the Screen Dump, Capture and BackScroll files.  The default is ON.  Turning
this OFF means that data is appended to their files without the header.

The Options configuration menu controls Qmodem operational settings and
parameters which fall in the following seven categories:

61 Toggles  Switches for features such as video mode, audible alarm,
which may be ON or OFF.  This option has a detailed sub-menu.

60 Runtime Parms  Parameters which were specified on the command line in
previous releases of Qmodem.  These parameters include Expanded Memory (EMS)
use, keyboard support, automatic Zmodem download, communications port
handling, and buffered UART support.

59 Memory  Qmodem memory allocation specifications.  This option has a
detailed sub-menu.

NOTE: This menu option does not display if Setup is invoked via Alt-N from
inside Qmodem.  It is only available when run from Qinstall program.

58 Sounds  Fine-tuning of event-specific beeps and bells.  This option has a

Qmodem toggles consist of 16 parameters which can be set ON or OFF to
control specific aspects of Qmodem operation.  To change the toggle setting,
type the toggle's highlighted letter or cursor to it and press Enter.

Beeps & Bells  Activates or deactivates Qmodem audible signals for connect
and up/download completion.  This toggle can be changed with the Alt-B
command.

ANSI Music  If ON, Qmodem will play ANSI music if found in the incoming
data.  This toggle can be changed with the Alt-M command.

DEL/^H Backspace  Alternates the BACKSPACE Key's value between the true
backspace character ^H and the DEL character.  This can be Toggled from
Terminal mode with the Alt-1 command.

Auto Start Log  When ON, causes Qmodem to record activity to the log file
immediately upon startup.  If OFF, logging can be manually started with the
Alt-0 command.
!Page

Keypad Emulation  Determines the characters generated by the keyboard
numeric pad when keyboard numeric lock (NumLock) is ON.  If Keypad Emulation
is ON, Qmodem generates the proper key or escape codes, based on the
terminal emulation in effect.  If Keypad Emulation is OFF, Qmodem will
generate standard numeric values.

ENQ response  When set ON, the text stored in the Alt-F12 function key is
sent to the modem.  When set OFF, the ENQ ^E is not acted upon.  Normal
ctrl-character conversion is done on the text, so the two characters ^F
are converted to a Ctrl-F.

NOTE: Special @ macros are not executed when invoked via the ENQ function
for Alt-F12 only.

Guard Alt-H  When set ON, you will be asked to verify your intention to
issue the Hangup command if you are ONLINE.  If set OFF, then the Hangup is
done immediately.

0xE0 Doorway Codes  When set ON,131 Doorway mode will be allowed to send the
enhanced 101 key keyboard codes.  When set OFF, the extra E0 (hex) byte is
stripped and not sent.
!Topic 102 Setup/Options/Toggles/FON
!Noindex

Tag Advance in Alt-D  When set ON, the ScrollBar will advance to the next
entry in the Phone Book after you tag an entry.  When set OFF, the ScrollBar
does not move automatically.

ALT-D AutoStart  When set ON, the Alt-D Phone Book is popped up after
starting the program.  When set OFF, you will remain in Terminal Mode on
startup.

NOTE: If this is set ON, it will be overridden if either the /HOST or /S=
command line options are used.  This prevents the Phone Book from interfering
with either the Host Mode or an Auto Start Script.

Clear FKey Tags  When set ON, using the Quick Dial Fkeys in the Alt-D
Phone Book will clear any previously tagged entries first.  When set OFF,
previously tagged entries remain tagged before tagging any new entries.

Write FBK File  When set ON, any changes to the FON book will result in an
FBK Backup file being created.  This file will be the same size as the
FON, so you should allow for this disk space.  Floppy users may want to turn
this option OFF to conserve space.
!Topic 60 Setup/Option/Runtime
!Noindex

Qmodem Runtime parameters are similar to the Qmodem Toggles in that they
control specific aspects of Qmodem operation.   These parameters were set
via command-line options in previous releases of Qmodem.  To change a
parameter's setting, type the corresponding highlighted letter or move the
menu selector to the entry and press Enter.

EMS for Overlays  Activates or deactivates the use of Expanded Memory
(EMS).  When ON, and sufficient EMS memory is available, Qmodem will load
the entire overlay file into Expanded Memory.  If there is not sufficient
EMS memory available or this parameter is OFF, Qmodem will dynamically load
the overlay file from disk.  

Use of EMS memory will significantly improve performance by eliminating
overlay-related disk activity.  The amount of EMS memory required to store
the Overlay is slightly higher than the size of the QMODEM.OVR file.  Other
aspects of Qmodem may draw on the available EMS memory as needed.

Int16 Enable  When ON, Qmodem uses an internal keyboard input handler
which supports 101-key enhanced keyboards, including the F11 & F12 function
keys.  When OFF, Qmodem uses the standard DOS input handler and the F11 &
F12 function keys are not supported.

NOTE: If the computer is not equipped with an enhanced keyboard, or the ROM
BIOS does not support such a keyboard, this parameter cannot be toggled ON.

Share IRQ's  When ON, Qmodem will correctly share interrupts on PS/2 and
EISA bus equipped computers.  When set OFF, Qmodem will not pass interrupts
on to the previous interrupt handlers if any were present.  If you are
running a PC, XT or AT based system, then this should be set OFF.

Optimum Shell  When ON, Qmodem will attempt to remove all but 5K of itself
from memory before all shell operations (external transfer protocols, Alt-R
drop to DOS, etc.)  If the EMS USAGE is set ON, then it first tries to store
the copy into EMS memory.  If there is not enough free EMS or the EMS USAGE
is OFF, then it tries to swap to DISK.  If there is not enough DISK space,
the Optimum Shell is disabled.

-- Disk Shell  This toggle works only when the Optimum Shell toggle is set
ON.  If OFF, this toggle has no effect.  Assuming the Optimum Shell is ON,
this toggle controls whether or not the Swap file can be placed on Disk.
!Page

If ON, then a Disk file will be attempted if you have insufficient EMS memory
to hold the Swap file (or the Use EMS toggle is set OFF).  If OFF, and you
have run out of EMS, then the Optimum Shell is disabled.

Calibrate DELAY  When set ON, the internal timer routine will automatically
calibrate itself periodically.  This could be necessary if running under
multitaskers or running on a network server. (the latter is strongly
discouraged however).
!Topic 59 Setup/Options/Memory
!Noindex

Qmodem allows user-specified memory allocations for these storage areas:  

Lines of ScrollBack  Memory is allocated as the maximum number of lines
which can be stored in the scrollback buffer.

Download Buffer  Downloaded data is stored into the download buffer. When
the buffer is full, it is copied to disk.  Each buffer is 128 bytes, and from
8 to 240 buffers can be allocated.  When downloading to a hard disk or RAM
disk, use the smallest allocation of 8.  When downloading to a floppy, use a
medium to high value to increase efficiency.   Large allocations are at the
expense of system memory.

Overlay Buffer  Used to store code segments from the Overlay File.  The
default value is 30K.  Increasing this value will reduce disk activity
during the loading of program overlay files at the expense of memory.  If
Qmodem seems too slow, this should be increased in 2K increments until
execution speed is satisfactory.
!Topic 58 Setup/Options/Sounds
!Noindex

Qmodem can use Beeps and Bells to indicate a successful connect or the
completion of a file transfer.  The default state is defined in the Alt-N/O/T
menu.  Outside the configuration menu, this feature can be toggled on or off
with the Alt-B command.  The Sounds menu allows changes to the pitch of these
sounds to suit users' preferences.  Three sounds can be configured:

Connect Tones  This multi-note jingle has its own custom menu.  Qmodem
produces a 3-note chime following a successful connection.  The default
frequencies for the three notes are 1200, 1400, and 1600 cycles.  These can
be changed to suit the user's preferences.  All 3 notes are played following
each change.  To change a value type the desired number, enter the new
value, and press Enter.

Max  This entry is under the Connect Tones menu.  It controls the maximum
number iterations of the Connect tones when you get connected via the Alt-D
Phone Book.  Remember, this is the maximum number.  You can always cancel the
tones with a press of any key.
!Page

Up/Download  A single beep will be produced at the completion of each file
transfer.  The frequency of the sound can be changed.  A sample beep will be
heard after each change.  The default frequency for the file transfer
completion tones is 1200 cycles.
!Topic 57 Setup/Options/Delays
!Noindex

Delay values affect the timing of certain Qmodem operations:

Status Windows  Most toggle or immediate commands have an accompanying
window showing the change in status.  The value in this field, expressed in
1/100th sec., controls the duration the windows' display.  The default is
300 (or 3 seconds).

NOTE: A low value in the Status Window delay field will cause a very short
display which may not be noticed.

File Transfers  File transfer errors such as Short/Long blocks can occur
on high-speed, buffered modems when the COM port rate is fixed at a higher
speed than the CONNECT rate --for example, when operating a USR HST or Hayes
V9600 modem with a COM port speed of 9600 or 19200, and when connected to a
slower 1200/2400 modem--.  Set this option to 20 (seconds) to allow data and
the end-of-block message to pass through the buffers before Qmodem times
out.  This delay is not generally needed if the serial port speed is not set
above 2400bps.
!Page

BREAK timing  This is the number of milliseconds that Qmodem will hold the
BREAK signal high when Ctrl-End is pressed or specified in the Dialing setup
options.  Values from 0 to 2000 (2 seconds) are valid.

DTR timing  This is the number of milliseconds that Qmodem will hold the
DTR signal low when specified in the Modem setup options.  Values from 0 to
2000 (2 seconds) are valid.
!Topic 92 Setup/Video/Toggles/Emulations

Bulletin Boards usually require the TTY emulation for normal text mode, or
the ANSI emulation which allows changing colors.  If you see a prompt
something like "Do you want Graphics (Y/N) ?" from the BBS, you should
answer NO if you have TTY selected.  If you have ANSI, you can go either
way.

Mainframe computers usually rely on the VT100 or TVI 925 emulation.  Be
aware that the 925 emulation in Qmodem is not 100%.  We strongly suggest
using the VT100 if you have a choice between the two.

Avatar is a superset of the ANSI emulation and gaining popularity with the
OPUS Bulletin Board systems.

Debug ASCII and Debug HEX are special modes that display control characters
in HEX or ASCII mode.

                Elapsed Mask       - hh:mm:ss

The Time and Date 101 Picture Masks  are used throughout the code (except where noted) to
display time and date fields.

To change a separator or indicator value, select the desired character and
press the direction keys to select another character values.  When the
desired character is highlighted, press Enter.  Press Esc to leave the

problems when copied directly to a printer with a PrtSc function.
!Topic 101 Picture Masks
!NoIndex

To allow the maximum amount of flexibility and to insure that the TIME and
DATE routines can be used internationally, you can specify a picture mask
to indicate how a given string should be formatted. 

For example, let's say that a date variable contains January 2, 1990 and you
want to display it. There are several possible picture masks you could use:

      Picture           Result
      ----------------------------
      mm/dd/yy          01/02/90
      MM/dd/yy           1/02/90     (note the Case difference)
      mm/dd/yyyy        01/02/1990
      mm-dd-yyyy        01-02-1990
      dd/mm/yyyy        02/01/1990

Time strings are handled in a similar fashion, except that special formatting
characters are available for working with times in am/pm (12-hour) format as
well as military (24-hour) format.  
!Page

For example, lets say it is 1:02pm and you want to display this in a
different format.  Here are some possible picture masks:

      Picture           Result
      -----------------------------
      hh:mm:ss          13:02:00
      hh:mm             13:02
      hh:mm te          01:02 pm
      hh:mmt            01:02p
      HH:MM:SS          13:02:00
      hh:mm:sste        01:02:00pm

Note that string representations of time are always assumed to be in military
format unless a 't' appears in the picture mask.  An 'e' (em) in the mask
should always be accompanied by a corrosponding 't' (time).

Now that you have a general idea of what picture masks do, let's look at the
characters that can appear in them.  
!Page

The following special characters are meaningful in masks:

      Char       is replaced by
      --------------------------------------------------
      'm', 'M'   Month      (date fields only)
      'd', 'D'   Day        (date)
      'y'        Year       (date, notice 'Y' is a literal)
      'h', 'H'   Hour       (time fields only)
      'm', 'M'   Minutes    (time)
      's', 'S'   Seconds    (time)
      't'        'p' or 'a' (time dependant)
      'e'        'm'        (usually follows the 't')


Any other characters are treated as literals and just displayed.
!Topic 56 Setup/Exit
!Noindex

The Configuration Exit Menu has two options:

Save Changes  Save the changes to the QMODEM.CNF file and exit the menu.

Abandon  Leave the configuration menu and do not save the changes. Pressing
Esc while at the main menu level has the same effect.  

NOTE:  All changes will be lost if you select Abandon.
!Topic 75 Selecting a new Character
!NoIndex

This Pick List allows you to select a new value for the character you are
trying to change.

Move around with the direction keys until the character you want is
highlighted.  Press Enter to use the new character or Esc to leave the
window without changing the character.
!Topic 90 Help with ONLINE HELP
!NoIndex

See?  Not so hard after all!  Actually, all three selections have been
programmed to bring you to this page.

This was intentional, because I want to show you another feature of the Help
System.  You can move to the Previous Topic by pressing Alt F1.


             (Do this to get back to where we were before!)
!Topic 54 Terminal Mode
!NoIndex

You are now in what is called TERMINAL MODE.  This is where you can enter
modem commands while Offline, and communicate with a remote computer while
Online.

If you need a list of Commands that are available, press Esc to exit the
Help System and then press the Home key.

If you would like to see the Index of Help Topics, press F1

!Topic 91  Help with ONLINE HELP       
!Index 1

                  Welcome to the Qmodem Online Help System.

We have tried to make this as easy to use as possible, in the event you
needed help and wanted to locate the required information quickly.

Normally, when you ask for help in Qmodem, you are shown the screen that
most likely holds the answer to your question.  Unfortunately, mind-reading
is not built in, so we included an index for the entire Help System.


                    Navigating through the Help System

The first thing you should learn how to do is navigate through the Help
screens.  The screens themselves may contain one or more pages of
information (like this one).  If more than one page is available, the bottom
right corner will look like this:
                                      ณ
                                      ณ
                        ออออออออ PgDn พ

  (Press PgDn now)
!Page

Always look in the lower right corner to see if the Help Screen has more than
one page.  If it has more that two pages, you will see PgUp/PgDn as the
option.

Another way to move around is to select items that are highlighted
Selection boxes.  There can be more than one on a page, depending on what
the Help screen is about.  

For example, below are three possible selections which may reference new
Topics in the Help System.  To move between them, you use the Left and Right
Arrow keys.   



    90 Selection 1        90 Selection 2        90 Selection 3 



                       (try it out right now!)

!Page

The Status Line below lists the available commands, but let's go over them
to be sure you understand how they work.

[F1] for Topic Index

We can assume you figured this one out, or you wouldn't be reading this
screen!  This displays an alphabetical list of all the Help Topics in the
Help System.  Not all help screens are listed however.  Some Topics branch
off and do not need Index entries.  All of the major Topics are covered
though.    See 55 Moving around in the INDEX  for more information.

[Alt-F1] for Previous Topic

This feature is demonstrated on the previous page.  To recap, you can move
backwards through the Help screens by pressing the Alt-F1 key.  If you
reach the original Help screen first displayed, this key does nothing.

[Esc] Exit Help

This takes you back to Qmodem where you were before you asked for more help.
!Topic 26 Dialing Directory (Alt-D)

Phone numbers and related information are stored in the Qmodem Dialing
Directory.   Multiple Dialing Directories may be loaded with up to 200
entries stored in each directory.  QMODEM.FON is the default dialing
directory that is loaded.

Dialing Directory commands allow you to Dial another system, Edit the
current FON book, and attach NOTES to individual entries.

The Phone book is divided into two sections, with each section able to
display two different screens.  The top section will look something like
this:

 ีอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ Phone Book ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

!Page

The top line tells you which FON file you are viewing and the current page
number.  The next line down tells you how many entries are tagged for dialing
and how many Prefix letters have been defined.


Name  This field is used to name the system.  Length: 27 characters.  It
can be anything you want, but should not be left blank (for sorting reasons).

The Name field can also contain an FKey Hotkey assignment string.  The
example above shows entries 1,2 and 3 with FKeys assigned.  F2 thru F12 can
be assigned to an entry by enclosing the assignment in { } brackets.

Number  This is the phone number to dial.  Length: 19 characters.  You can
put any character in here you want, but make sure it is a subset of your
modem's DIAL command.  In addition, you can use the Prefix modifier
characters A-J to make the number longer than just 19 characters.

COM  This is the serial port parameters to be used.  Baud rate, Data bits,
Parity and Stop bits are shown.
!Page

Script  This is the name of a Script file if one is attached.  Length: 12
Characters.  If you attach a script to an entry, it will get executed
automatically when you dial and get connected.  If the script does not
actually exist, then QuickLearn will create it the first time automatically!


If you press O (for Other Info), the top portion changes and looks like
the following:

Password  A convenient place to store system passwords.  Length: 14
characters.  This is more than convenient because there are other built-in
commands that can make use of this field after a connection.  There is a
corresponding Script Language variable called $PASSWORD that is loaded with
the Password in the entry.

LastCall  The date on which you last connected.  This field is
automatically updated every time you call the system and get connected. 
Aborted dial attempts and BUSY's do not update this field.

Total  The number of times you have connected.  Length: 5 digits.  This too
gets updated every time you connect to the system.

P  (for Protocol)  This is the default transfer protocol you want to use on
the system.  If defined, this is placed in the Upload and Download protocol
selection window by default.  If none is defined, you have to select a
protocol for each transfer.

D  (for Duplex)  This is the default Duplex to use when calling the system.
Can be either H for Half Duplex or F for Full Duplex.

Each page of the phone book will display 10 entries, unless you are in 43/50
line mode.  Then you get 20 entries per page (and half as many pages).

(Press PgDn for more on Commands)

The Commands section is the bottom portion of the window and looks like this:

Commands are divided into 5 groups:

ENTRIES  Commands affecting directory entries such as Revise or Delete.

DIAL  Commands which start the dialing or exit the Dialing  Directory.

EDIT  Commands used to edit notes or scripts linked to the current entry.

FON  Commands which manipulate the Directory itself such as Load.

MOVEMENT  Implied Commands/Keys used to navigate through the Directory.  


All changes to the Dialing Directory are saved to the disk immediately.  When
a Revise, Tag with Prefix, Insert, Delete, Sort operation is performed, the
old version of the directory is saved under its current name with the .FBK
extension.

The last major change to the directory can be cancelled with the ^U Undo
command.
